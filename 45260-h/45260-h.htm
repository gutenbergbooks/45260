<h1 title="">DORIS FORCE AT
<br />LOCKED GATES</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">A QUEER INVITATION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What are you waiting for, Doris? You&rsquo;ve
been hanging on that gatepost all afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marshmallow&rdquo; Mallow, a chubby, pleasant-faced
youth flung away the core of an apple and
came slowly down the walk toward the girl he had
just addressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m waiting for the postman,&rdquo; Doris Force,
an unusually pretty miss of sixteen, tossed carelessly
over her shoulder as she continued to gaze
down the street. &ldquo;He just turned the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be you&rsquo;re expecting a very important
letter,&rdquo; Marshmallow drawled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s from
Dave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go eat another apple!&rdquo; Doris retorted
goodnaturedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a letter from
Kitty Norris, my chum at boarding school. I&rsquo;m
anxious to find out what she&rsquo;s planning to do this
vacation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sure going to be dull here at Chilton this
summer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish something exciting would turn up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, but nothing ever does.&rdquo; Gloomily,
Marshmallow thrust his hand into his coat pocket
and brought out two candy bars. &ldquo;Have one,
Doris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks. I don&rsquo;t see how you can enjoy
eating all the time! Why, if you keep on, you&rsquo;ll
land in the circus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris knew from past experience that her gibes
would be accepted in the bantering spirit in which
they were intended. She had known Marshall
Mallow for a number of years, and, in fact, they
had resided in the same house, for Doris&rsquo;s uncle,
Wardell Force, rented a suite of rooms from Marshall&rsquo;s
mother, Mrs. Thomas Mallow.</p>
<p>Though Doris and Marshall were as unlike as it
was possible for two persons to be, they were the
best of friends. Marshmallow, who answered to
his given name only when his mother called, was
liked by nearly everyone in the neighborhood, but
he was subjected to a great deal of teasing because
he was decidedly fat. He was a year older than
Doris but frequently was mistaken as the younger
of the two.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>If Marshmallow were easy going and perhaps
inclined to be a trifle lazy, Doris made up for his
lack of energy. She was studious, and tremendously
interested in athletics and music, particularly
the latter. It was her ambitious dream that
some day she would win fame as a singer in grand
opera. Doris was utterly without vanity and
would never admit that she was talented. As for
her appearance, she never could understand why
her friends were envious of her dark red curly hair
and deep blue eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here the mailman comes at last,&rdquo; she sighed in
relief, as she saw the man turn in at the house next
door. &ldquo;Oh, I do hope he has something for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later the postman stopped at the
Mallow gate and began to look through a pack of
letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, young lady,&rdquo; he said with a
pleasant smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two!&rdquo; Doris gasped in delight. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
better than I had hoped for.&rdquo; Quickly, she
scanned the postmarks. &ldquo;And this one is from
Kitty, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eagerly, she ripped open the envelope. The
letter, written in an almost illegible scrawl, was
brief, for Kitty Norris had never been a satisfactory
correspondent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty hasn&rsquo;t made any plans for the summer
yet,&rdquo; she informed Marshmallow as she replaced
the letter in the envelope. &ldquo;She thinks it would
be fun if we could go to some summer camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could&mdash;but there&rsquo;s the problem of
money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your uncle will give it to you. He thinks
you&rsquo;re just right and he couldn&rsquo;t deny you anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Ward is a dear and he&rsquo;s always given me
everything I want, but I don&rsquo;t like to ask for too
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your own money, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Uncle Ward has looked after my property
ever since Mother and Father died, but the other
day he told me he wanted to have a long talk with
me about money. I guess I&rsquo;ve been using it up
dreadfully fast. Boarding school costs such a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it shouldn&rsquo;t cost so much to go camping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Doris agreed, more cheerfully.
&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll ask him if I can&rsquo;t go. Oh, dear, I
don&rsquo;t see why one has to worry about money all
the time! I&rsquo;d just be sick, if I found out I couldn&rsquo;t
go on with my music lessons. It would seem so
funny to be poor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t see anything funny about it,&rdquo;
Marshmallow said as he thoughtfully munched a
candy bar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really mean it would be funny,&rdquo; Doris
corrected. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always had the things I&rsquo;ve
needed and until Uncle Ward spoke to me the other
day, it never occurred to me that I didn&rsquo;t have a
substantial income.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>Remembering that she had not read her second
letter, she tore open the envelope and glanced
curiously at the message. It was written in a fine
but cramped hand, and Doris turned over at once
to the signature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Azalea and Iris Gates,&rdquo; she read aloud. &ldquo;How
very odd!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s odd?&rdquo; Marshmallow demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, just listen to this letter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My dear Miss Force: We understand you are
the only daughter of the late Louise Trent Force.
We knew her a great many years ago, and now
after many years of heartache over her older
brother, John, we find a most unusual circumstance
has arisen. Could you come to Rumson and visit
our home in order to acquaint yourself with the
present affairs pertaining to John Trent, your
uncle? Very truly yours, Azalea and Iris Gates.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never told me you had an uncle by that
name, Doris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it myself, Marshmallow! This
is all news to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of queer they invite you down to their
place at Rumson, isn&rsquo;t it? A fellow would think
they could write anything they wanted to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps this is only an excuse for something
else,&rdquo; Doris said, thoughtfully scanning the letter
a second time. &ldquo;What do you suppose they mean
by saying they want to acquaint me with the present
affairs pertaining to my uncle? I hope I&rsquo;m
going to inherit some money! I need it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fat chance,&rdquo; Marshmallow grunted. &ldquo;More &rsquo;n
likely they&rsquo;ll ask you for some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris did not reply, for just then a smart red
roadster swung around the corner. It did not appear
to be running smoothly and the driver, a man
of perhaps thirty, dressed immaculately but in
rather sporty attire, brought the car to a standstill
not a half dozen yards from where Doris and
Marshmallow were standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what?&rdquo; they heard him mutter angrily.</p>
<p>Doris and Marshmallow moved over toward the
car, curious to learn what was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having trouble?&rdquo; Marshmallow inquired pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it look like?&rdquo; the stranger snapped
crossly. &ldquo;This car hasn&rsquo;t run decently for the last
fifteen miles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps your gas line is plugged,&rdquo; Marshmallow
suggested, lifting the hood. &ldquo;Yep, that&rsquo;s
just what it is. Give me a wire or something and
I can fix it in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gas line plugged?&rdquo; the driver grumbled as he
searched in the tool case. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I get for
buying cheap gas at Rumson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris glanced up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know of Rumson?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever hear of people there named Gates?&rdquo;
Marshmallow questioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>The driver gave him a sharp glance and muttered
something which neither Doris nor Marshmallow
could make out. To their surprise, he brushed
past them and slammed down the hood. Then he
sprang into the roadster and without a word of
explanation started the motor and drove rapidly
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">A FRIENDLY NOTE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you know about that?&rdquo; Marshmallow
ejaculated, as he watched the red roadster
vanish down the street. &ldquo;I would have fixed his
old gas line if he hadn&rsquo;t been in such a rush. The
big grouch! I hope it plugs up so badly he can&rsquo;t
keep going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what made him drive off in such a
hurry,&rdquo; Doris returned. &ldquo;We just asked him if he
knew any one by the name of Gates and he looked
at us so suspiciously&mdash;or rather, I should say
guardedly. I wish I knew where Rumson was.
I&rsquo;m beginning to get interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look it up on the map,&rdquo; Marshmallow suggested.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one in the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried up the walk toward the Mallow
residence. It was a modern brick English type
structure, located on a shady side street of Chilton
in the suburbs of Plainfield, and was one of the
most attractive houses in the city. The grounds
were beautifully landscaped with silver-tipped
evergreens, an abundance of rhododendrons and
scarlet azaleas. The interior of the house was
equally inviting, for Mrs. Mallow was noted as an
excellent housekeeper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Marshmallow found the road map in the desk
and brought it out upon the porch. Doris spread
it out between them and they pored over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; Marshmallow declared after a little
search. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be more than fifty miles away.
You take the Center Ridge road. It&rsquo;s just a small
town. You&rsquo;d have a heck of a summer there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s out in the direction Dave lives,&rdquo; Doris remarked
absently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure, I forgot that!&rdquo; Marshmallow drawled
teasingly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a peach of a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s an aviation field near Rumson,&rdquo;
Doris went on, scarcely noticing what her companion
had said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means Dave can fly down to see you every
day or so. No wonder girls fall for fellows that are
aviators!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave isn&rsquo;t a full-fledged one yet,&rdquo; Doris returned
proudly, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;ll soon finish his flying
course and then he expects to get a license.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Transport or marriage?&rdquo; Marshmallow grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go chase yourself!&rdquo; Doris retorted slangily.</p>
<p>Marshmallow got up from the porch and lazily
stretched himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I will,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;I can smell
cookies baking in the kitchen, and I&rsquo;ll just ankle
around and coerce Mother into parting with a few
dozen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>After Marshmallow had gone inside, Doris continued
to study the map for several minutes and
then tossed it aside as she caught sight of her uncle
coming up the walk. Eagerly, she ran to meet
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you in those packages?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, something nice for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he smiled indulgently down upon her, Doris
could not but think how very fortunate she was
to have such a generous and handsome uncle.
Though Wardell Force was of middle age, with
hair fast turning gray, he walked with the step of
a boy and his energy was equal to that of any
dozen average men. His voice was low pitched,
but of singular quality which made one instinctively
turn to listen when he spoke.</p>
<p>For many years he had conducted a successful
drug store, but had retired from active business to
follow his hobby of rescue mission work, welfare
and charities. He was naturally a leader of men
and in great demand to head committees and speak
at important gatherings. Doris was proud of his
ability to move large crowds with his magnetic
voice. However, she sometimes felt that he was
so engrossed in helping others that he neglected
himself. Frequently, she had known him to go
without a new suit of clothes that he might give
the money to some deserving poor family.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Ward, you&rsquo;re always buying things for
me,&rdquo; she told him as she accepted the packages.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re so good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat down in the porch swing and Doris
eagerly began to unwrap the parcels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Candy!&rdquo; she exclaimed in delight. &ldquo;And
novelty jewelry, too. I can&rsquo;t thank you enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the beads?&rdquo; Uncle Ward asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not much of a hand at picking out trinkets for the
ladies. Thought they might be a little too conservative
for a giddy red-head like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; Doris scoffed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not giddy and
you&rsquo;re not conservative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her uncle laughed and rumpled her curls.
&ldquo;Dory,&rdquo; he began, the smile fading, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
I shall have to leave you alone for a few days each
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been named chairman of a committee to
raise funds for fresh air camps and the campaign
will be carried on all summer. That means I must
go out of town frequently. We shall have to plan
something nice for you to do during my absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty Norris wants me to go camping with her.
May I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shadow passed over Wardell Force&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been intending to talk to you about the
state of your finances for some time,&rdquo; he said
slowly, without answering her question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Thoughtfully he stroked his hair, avoiding his
niece&rsquo;s eyes. How he hated to inform her that her
funds were running low and that a camping trip
was therefore inadvisable! Somehow, girls seemed
to need a great deal of money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so worried, Uncle Ward,&rdquo; Doris said
lightly, observing his preoccupation, and shrewdly
guessing the thoughts which were passing through
his mind. &ldquo;I have news for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she could tell him of the letter she had
received from the Misses Gates, there was an unexpected
interruption. Jake, the hired man whom
Wardell Force had rescued from the slums many
years before, came rushing up to the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a plane going over,&rdquo; he told Doris with
a grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet two cents it&rsquo;s that boy friend of
yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time, Doris became aware of the low
hum of an airplane motor, and with her uncle following
at a more dignified pace, rushed out into the
yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> Dave!&rdquo; she cried in delight, as she observed
a bright red star on either wing of a monoplane
which was heading directly toward the Mallow
residence.</p>
<p>The plane rapidly approached, swinging so low
that the observers on the ground could plainly see
the intrepid young flier in the cockpit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose he can be having engine
trouble?&rdquo; Doris murmured anxiously. &ldquo;I never
saw him fly at such a low altitude before! Oh, I
wish he wouldn&rsquo;t take such risks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her alarm was greater than that of either Jake
or her uncle, but then, their interest in David
Chamberlin was more impersonal. Doris had
known the young aviator for several years and was
well aware that his liking for her had steadily
grown. However, since she was but sixteen and
Dave only a few years older, her uncle refused to
consider the affair as a serious one.</p>
<p>Wardell Force had looked after Doris with the
interest and kindness of a father, and, as Mrs.
Mallow frequently remarked, he had done very
well for a bachelor. He had sent her to Barry
Manor, a good boarding school, and had given her
training by the best vocal teachers in the city. In
some ways, Mr. Force had been overindulgent and
he found it increasingly difficult to acquaint his
niece with the stern fact that the few thousand
dollars she had inherited were fast dwindling away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>Doris and her uncle made their home with Mrs.
Thomas Mallow, renting a lovely upstairs suite,
consisting of two bedrooms, bath and den. Mrs.
Mallow, a plump and jolly widow noted for her
ability as a cook, gave them their meals and was
nearly as fond of Doris as she was of her own son.
Doris was likewise a favorite of Jake, the hired
man, though his devotion was expressed only by
the way his eyes followed her whenever she was
near. Wardell Force had told her little of what
he knew concerning the man&rsquo;s past, and since he
had come to work at the Mallow residence he had
been addressed only by the name of &ldquo;Jake.&rdquo;
Though Doris was much too tactful to question him
outright, she often had provided opportunity for
him to tell the story of his life, but he had always
seemed unwilling to offer any information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do wish Dave wouldn&rsquo;t try any stunts!&rdquo;
Doris exclaimed as she watched the monoplane
slowly circle above the Mallow residence. &ldquo;Why,
he&rsquo;s dropped something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, she saw a piece of weighted paper
fall from the plane. It struck the sidewalk a short
distance away and before she could recover from
her surprise, Jake had rushed to pick it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, Miss Doris,&rdquo; he said, handing it
to her. &ldquo;I &rsquo;spects it&rsquo;s a love note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is, it&rsquo;s certainly a new way to get one!&rdquo;
Doris laughed.</p>
<p>Trying not to show her excitement, she quickly
scanned the message. It read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will stop in Saturday morning and take you to
the big aviation meet in my roadster. Dave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monoplane continued to circle at a low altitude
and Doris, upon reading the note, promptly
waved her handkerchief in token of assent. She
watched until the plane had vanished toward the
eastern horizon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what was the meaning of all that pantomime?&rdquo;
Uncle Ward asked with an amused twinkle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave&rsquo;s going to stop for me Saturday and take
me to the aviation meet in his roadster. I&rsquo;m
thrilled to death! I was hoping he&rsquo;d ask me, but
I was afraid he wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So? Well, I&rsquo;m glad he said roadster and not
airplane,&rdquo; Wardell Force grunted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
you to go flying around with any student aviator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave is nearly through his course now, Uncle
Ward, and he&rsquo;s considered the best of all those who
are studying at the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. And now that the excitement is
over, we can get back to that discussion we were
having. Perhaps we had better step into the
den.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soberly, Doris followed her uncle into the house.
She realized that the discussion was to center about
money, and hoped that nothing would interfere
with her plan to spend the summer with Kitty.
Once they were settled in the comfortable den, she
showed him the letter she had received from her
chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t cost very much just to spend a few
weeks at a camp,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it isn&rsquo;t
a very expensive one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wardell Force did not reply immediately, but sat
looking at the rug. At last he said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to deny you anything, Doris, but
I&rsquo;m afraid you don&rsquo;t understand just how matters
stand. Your carfare to this camp would cost considerable
and of course you would need clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just knickers and sport things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they all cost money, Doris&mdash;a great deal
more than you realize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought my inheritance would cover everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your money has been going very fast, my
dear,&rdquo; her uncle told her gently. &ldquo;Your schooling
has cost a great deal, and only today I received a
letter saying that the tuition was to be doubled.
Your music, too, has made deep inroads into your
little fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no idea it was as bad as that,&rdquo; Doris said
soberly. &ldquo;I suppose I could give up boarding
school and my music lessons&mdash;though I&rsquo;d rather go
to work than stop my singing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you give up your school or your
music either, Dory. And I frankly admit, I hate
to see you go into an office. You are much too
young. You should have your good times now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I haven&rsquo;t any money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still have some, Dory. I am only telling
you this, that you will understand the situation and
be as careful of expenses as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Doris promised, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll start by giving
up that camping trip. I suppose, though, I
won&rsquo;t get to see Kitty this summer&mdash;unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>She broke off and her face lighted up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot the letter I received from the Misses
Gates!&rdquo; she finished. &ldquo;Perhaps they offer the
solution to all my troubles!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">A PROSPECTIVE VISIT</span></h2>
<p>Doris brought out the crumpled letter written
by the Misses Gates which she had thrust carelessly
into her pocket, and handed it to her uncle.
Adjusting his glasses, he read it through and then
sat thoughtfully stroking his hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; Doris demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very strange indeed. But just how do you
think this letter will help to solve your financial
problems?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought perhaps I am to inherit some
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wardell Force folded the letter and returned it
to his niece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope for your sake that you are right, but I
would advise you not to build up your hopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I should go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely know what to say, Doris. I recall
that years ago your mother had an older brother
who for some reason or other left home to travel.
He was a young man at that time. To the best of
my knowledge he was never heard of again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How queer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, as I remember, the members of the family
were unwilling to talk of the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t leave because of some disgrace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as far as anyone knew. His leave-taking
was shrouded in mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew I had such an interesting relative!&rdquo;
Doris declared. &ldquo;The Misses Gates must
know more than that about him and I&rsquo;m curious
to learn what they may have to tell me. I wish I
could go to Rumson and visit them this summer.
May I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really think you would enjoy it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, but it would be something to do.
And then, of course there <i>is</i> a possibility that I am
to inherit money. If only Kitty were going along,
I know I&rsquo;d have fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know anything about these women
you are invited to visit, Doris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they must be nice,&rdquo; Doris urged. &ldquo;You
can almost tell by their handwriting&mdash;it&rsquo;s so refined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Ward smiled. When his niece&rsquo;s mind was
made up, he seldom could hold out against her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he gave in reluctantly. &ldquo;I suppose
I must say you may go. Mind, I don&rsquo;t feel entirely
easy about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rumson isn&rsquo;t very far away, Uncle Ward, and
nothing could happen to me. Besides, Dave lives
out that way, and he can sort of keep an eye on
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt but that he will do that, all right,&rdquo;
Mr. Force grunted. &ldquo;I suspect he is your real reason
for this trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, I never thought of that at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, run along.&rdquo; He glanced at the clock
on the mantel. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you be late for your music
lesson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guiltily, Doris snatched up a roll of music she
had dropped on the table and dashed into the bedroom
for her hat. With a hasty kiss dropped on
the top of her uncle&rsquo;s head, she dashed for the door
and clattered down the stairs two at a time.</p>
<p>Reaching the street, she ran all the way to the
corner and there swung upon the rear end of a
street car just as it was starting. Breathlessly,
she dropped into the nearest seat and looked at her
wrist watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes to four,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;If
this old car isn&rsquo;t too poky, I&rsquo;ll make it on time
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris seldom was late for her vocal lessons, for
her interest in music was genuine, and she realized
that it was a privilege to be a student of the famed
Herr Von Heflinger who accepted only the most
promising pupils. On more than one occasion,
Doris had become a trifle discouraged, for Von
Heflinger was strict and offered criticism more
freely than praise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>On this afternoon she reached the studio just as
the clock was striking four and so avoided the displeasure
of the master. Always blunt, he offered
only a few words of greeting and seated himself at
the piano, quickly arranging the music. Striking
a few chords, he selected a difficult piece and bade
Doris sing.</p>
<p>Somewhat disturbed by Von Heflinger&rsquo;s austere
manner, she began a trifle shakily, but before she
had sung a dozen notes, she found herself. Soon
she had forgotten her accompanist, had forgotten
everything save the song. She sang brilliantly
and with more feeling than ever before. Von
Heflinger caught the spirit and his hands moved
quickly over the keyboard, now running arpeggios,
now crashing in loud chords or falling so softly
that the tones were scarcely audible.</p>
<p>The last note of the song died away, and the
master turned to Doris with an expression she had
never seen on his face before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Miss Force,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have the divine
spark! You will go far! This summer you must
study hard your French and German&mdash;and perhaps,
who knows, you shall yet be presented in
Grand Opera!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris scarcely could believe her own ears, for
she knew her teacher was not given to idle praise.
Grand Opera! How she longed to become famous!
She could almost see herself on the stage,
taking her curtain calls, making her bows, accepting
the flowers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>She was brought back to reality by hearing her
teacher repeat, more sternly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This summer you must work&mdash;study hard your
languages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lesson went on, and at five o&rsquo;clock Doris left
the studio, still somewhat dazed at the thought of
what might be ahead of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will work,&rdquo; she told herself as she walked
slowly toward the street car. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll work night and
day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris had always been one to make the most of
her opportunities, and from childhood she had determined
upon a career. Her sweet bell-like soprano
voice had been inherited from her mother,
but only training and diligent practice had developed
its full power and volume. Doris&rsquo;s ability
and her willingness to help others had made her
much in demand as a singer at teas, parties and
entertainments.</p>
<p>Many girls would have been satisfied with such
popularity, but not Doris Force. From the very
start she had set her heart upon reaching the highest
rung in the ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must study my German and my French this
summer,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;and I really can&rsquo;t do
much by myself. I should have a teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This brought a cloud to her face, for she remembered
the discussion she had just had with her
uncle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo; she thought impatiently. &ldquo;I need it
so badly, and I don&rsquo;t see where it is coming from
unless it turns out that I am to inherit it from my
Uncle John Trent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">AN AVIATION MEET</span></h2>
<p>By Saturday, when David Chamberlin called to
take Doris to the aviation meet, her financial
troubles were temporarily forgotten. She was not
given to worrying unnecessarily, and on this day
nothing could have interfered with her fun.</p>
<p>As Doris stepped into the trim little roadster,
Dave cast her an admiring glance, noting that she
was dressed in a white sports costume which set off
her red hair to startling advantage. They made
an excellent pair. Dave was dark, tall, straight
as a cadet, and considered handsome by all of
Doris&rsquo;s friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave me a dreadful fright when you flew
so low over our house,&rdquo; Doris told him as they
drove swiftly toward the aviation field, which was
located some distance from Chilton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I? Sorry, but I just had to drop that
note.&rdquo; Dave smiled down upon her. &ldquo;Anyway,
you forget that I&rsquo;m getting to be an expert at handling
the joy-stick. I want to take you up one of
these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m crazy to fly with you! Perhaps Uncle
Ward won&rsquo;t let me, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can talk him around to it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>As they approached the aviation field, they were
forced to proceed at a slow rate, for the highway
was jammed with cars.</p>
<p>Entering the gateway, they parked the roadster
and then wandered about the field, inspecting the
various planes. Dave explained a great deal about
the distinguishing characteristics of the various
models and introduced her to a number of aviators
with whom he was acquainted. As the time approached
for the meet to begin, they sought their
seats in the improvised grandstand.</p>
<p>Presently the master of ceremonies announced
through the loud speakers that the opening event
would be an inside loop contest. A hush of expectancy
fell over the crowd as two planes zoomed
up from the field and immediately began to cut
vertical circles in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks so easy, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Doris murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but believe me, it isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Dave assured
her, without taking his eyes from the two planes.
&ldquo;If I could only do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as glad you can&rsquo;t, Dave. I&rsquo;d be afraid
to have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following the inside loop contest, a squadron of
army planes took to the air and thrilled the spectators
with a spectacular exhibition of formation
flying. Then came parachute jumping, dead-stick
landings, and exciting races. Doris found it impossible
to restrain her excitement as the planes
rounded the pylons, frequently banking to such an
angle that it seemed disaster could not be avoided.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>As a climax to the meet the master of ceremonies
announced that an intrepid young flier would entertain
the crowd with daring stunts. Doris and
Dave saw a brilliant red monoplane take off from
the field and climb to an altitude of several thousand
feet. Then, in quick succession, the red
plane went through barrel-rolls, loops, dives, falling
leaves, and wing-overs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boy&rsquo;s good!&rdquo; Dave exclaimed in admiration.</p>
<p>The words were scarcely spoken when Doris
gave a startled little cry. It had seemed to her
that, as the monoplane came out of a loop, something
was wrong. The plane seemed to waver,
and then, to Doris&rsquo;s terror, shot down in a tailspin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in the stunt,&rdquo; Dave assured her. &ldquo;The
pilot&rsquo;s just&mdash;&rdquo; he broke off and a look of horror
came into his own eyes as he saw that the man at
the stick was fighting desperately for control.</p>
<p>The spectators, suddenly made aware of the impending
disaster, sprang as one man to their feet
and cried out in fright. Women and children
covered their faces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>The plucky aviator had not given up. Struggling
frantically at the controls he refused to take
to his parachute and, only a short distance above
the field, brought the plane out of the spin. However,
he had scant time to alter the course, and to
those on the ground it was apparent that in landing
he would overshoot the designated area, which was
roped off.</p>
<p>Those who were not in the grandstand scattered
in all directions, and timid women screamed in
terror. Doris and Dave had instinctively arisen,
but no sound escaped them. It appeared almost
certain that the plane would hit a group of parked
cars near the fence.</p>
<p>Just at the critical moment, however, the pilot
managed to turn the monoplane enough to miss the
row of cars. As a wild cheer of admiration and relief
arose from the spectators, he brought the craft
to rest without mishap.</p>
<p>Instantly, a crowd of people swarmed about the
plane. The pilot tried to keep them back, but it
appeared almost certain that before policemen
could reach the scene, someone would be pushed
into the whirling propeller.</p>
<p>Doris and Dave were seated not far from where
the mishap had occurred, and now, with the intention
of trying to help, they rushed toward the
plane. Before they could reach the spot, the pilot
had switched off the engine. The crowd continued
to press about the plane, careless of the damage
they might do to wings or struts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back!&rdquo; Dave shouted, helping the policemen
and some mechanics to control the throng.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>Nearly everyone goodnaturedly backed away
from the monoplane, but one man refused to budge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That plane nearly struck my car!&rdquo; he shouted
angrily. &ldquo;Let me get at that pilot! I&rsquo;ll show
him a thing or two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Startled, Doris turned to look at the man and
was astonished to see that it was the driver who
had been stalled in front of the Mallow residence
only a few days before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, who does that fellow think he is, anyway?&rdquo;
Dave murmured impatiently. &ldquo;His old car wasn&rsquo;t
touched! If that pilot hadn&rsquo;t done some quick
thinking, someone would have been killed sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They watched as a policeman remonstrated with
him, and were disgusted at his sullen remarks.
After he had vented his spite sufficiently, he sprang
into his roadster and backed out of the parking
place so rapidly that women and children were
forced to scurry to escape the wheels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t care much whether he struck anyone
or not!&rdquo; Doris declared. &ldquo;That man is positively
vicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the excitement had died down, she and
Dave went to their own roadster. There was a
bad traffic jam and it was some time before they
reached the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly was a thrilling day,&rdquo; Doris told
her friend when they were on the highway. &ldquo;I
wouldn&rsquo;t have missed it for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you liked it,&rdquo; Dave returned. &ldquo;Next
year I hope to take part myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best part of it was that no one was injured,&rdquo;
Doris continued. &ldquo;It would have ruined
the entire meet if there had been a serious accident
there at the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drove along in silence for some time, but
as they approached the Mallow residence, she
broached the subject which had been troubling
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave, you&rsquo;ve frequently been to Rumson,
haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she began indirectly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been invited to visit there this summer.
Do you think I&rsquo;d like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a pretty decent town for its size.
Whom are you visiting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two sisters by the name of Gates. Azalea and
Iris Gates. Did you ever hear of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gates? Let me think. Oh, sure, I remember
their place. It&rsquo;s right at the edge of town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a house have they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s as big as a barn. Old and rambling.
It seems to be a sort of mysterious place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mysterious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about it myself, except
that I&rsquo;ve heard folks say there is something queer
about it. The neighbors call it &lsquo;Locked Gates.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why that name?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s because the double front gates are
always kept locked. A fence surrounds the garden,
and vines grow so thick on it you can&rsquo;t get a
glimpse inside. Take my advice, Doris, and don&rsquo;t
go there for a visit. It would give you the creeps!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">KITTY ARRIVES</span></h2>
<p>What Dave had told her about the old Gates
place in Rumson did not discourage Doris. If anything,
it made her more eager to spend a few weeks
at Locked Gates, for the thought of mystery was
indeed very intriguing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for her plans, she chanced to repeat
to her uncle what Dave had said, and that
worthy at once began to regard the proposed visit
with misgiving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I should let you go,&rdquo; he told her
doubtfully. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something funny about this
whole affair. Don&rsquo;t you think you had better
give up the trip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Ward, you said I could go,&rdquo; Doris
moaned. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t change your mind now. There
probably isn&rsquo;t anything mysterious about the place
anyway&mdash;Dave was just talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I shall do a little investigating of my
own,&rdquo; her uncle returned gravely.</p>
<p>He had already learned through a former business
associate that the Misses Gates were well
thought of in Rumson, but that of late years they
had kept close to their own premises. Recalling
that Jake had at one time worked in Rumson,
Wardell Force sauntered out into the garden where
he was weeding the flowers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jake,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;how are your posies
doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hired man straightened and regarded Mr.
Force with a delighted smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First rate, sir,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;First rate!
Miss Doris&rsquo;s roses goin&rsquo; to be in bloom inside of
another week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake&rsquo;s hobby was gardening, and he was never
more satisfied than when at work with the flowers.
The sun and wind had tanned his wrinkled face but
it had brought a glow of health which had not been
there when Wardell Force had first brought him to
Chilton. At that time Jake had been broken in
body and in spirit, but fresh air, good food and
kindness had made a new man of him. His hair,
which was streaked with gray, seldom was combed,
and his garments usually bore the stamp of his
work. He walked with a noticeable stoop.</p>
<p>Jake was a rather silent man and seldom spoke
unless addressed. He kept to himself and when
not working about the grounds usually stayed alone
in his room. Seemingly, he lived only for the present,
as he never mentioned the past and took the future
for granted. Of his devotion to Wardell Force
and Doris, there was not the slightest question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake, you used to work in Rumson before you
came here, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Mr. Force questioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; Jake avoided the other&rsquo;s eyes. Any
reference to his past usually caused him to withdraw
into his shell, but with Wardell Force he was
more free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember a Gates house there, Jake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I remember the place well. A gloomy
house it was, sir. Many a night I had to pass it
after dark, and it sort of gave me the creeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think anything could give you the
creeps,&rdquo; Mr. Force said with an understanding
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did I, sir, but that house&mdash;you never
saw a soul enter or leave. Folks said the gates had
rusted shut. But why are you askin&rsquo;, Mr. Force?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris was thinking of going there for a short
visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake shook his head as he picked up the rake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not aimin&rsquo; to advise you, sir, but if &rsquo;twere
me, I&rsquo;d not let her go there alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think perhaps you are right, Jake,&rdquo; Wardell
Force returned thoughtfully as he turned away.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have another talk with Doris and see if I can&rsquo;t
get her out of the notion of going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to the house, he found his niece in the
den studying German. She put aside her book at
once as he came over to her, but her face clouded
at mention of the visit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give it up if you&rsquo;re so worried, but I don&rsquo;t
see any reason for not going. The Misses Gates
are probably just two dear old ladies who like
privacy, and the neighbors are inclined to gossip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you have set your heart upon going,&rdquo; Mr.
Force sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will let me go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon one condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you get some one to go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know just the person, Uncle Ward. Kitty
Norris will be crazy to go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re both crazy to go,&rdquo; Mr. Force returned
with a different inflection.</p>
<p>Doris, highly pleased at her latest idea, sprang
up and rushed to the desk. It took her only a few
minutes to compose a letter to her chum, and having
finished it, she rushed off to the corner mail box,
fearful lest her uncle change his mind again.</p>
<p>The next three days she waited in a tremor of
excitement for a response. On the fourth day the
postman brought the letter from Kitty. It was
brief but very much to the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Dory:&rdquo; it read. &ldquo;Will I come? I&rsquo;ll
jump at the chance! Here&rsquo;s to a high old time at
Locked Gates, and may we discover when they
were locked and why! Meet me Wednesday on
the 4:40 train. Yours, Kitty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>It was already Monday and that left only two
days before Kitty&rsquo;s arrival. Doris flew about
putting the suite in order and spent a great deal
of time getting her clothes ready to pack. The
problem was made somewhat difficult due to the
fact that she did not know what sort of reception
awaited her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether they&rsquo;ll give any parties
or not,&rdquo; she told herself, &ldquo;but my guess is they
won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll take a chance on it and leave my evening
gown at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late Wednesday afternoon, Doris and her uncle
drove to the station to meet Kitty. She was
nearly the last one off the train and Doris was beginning
to think she had not come, when she
caught sight of her in the crowd.</p>
<p>The girls exchanged enthusiastic hugs and fell
to jabbering as excitedly as two magpies, or at
least so it seemed to Uncle Ward, who was quite
ignored until Doris recalled that she had failed to
introduce him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as though I know you already,&rdquo; he told
Kitty with his genial smile. &ldquo;Doris has talked
about you almost continually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He placed her suitcase in the back of the coup&eacute;,
and the girls squeezed in beside him on the front
seat. As they drove toward home, Doris told her
chum more about Locked Gates and the reason why
she had planned the trip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>Though not as pretty as Doris, Kitty had a
charming personality and was one of the most
popular girls at Barry Manor. She was very
talkative and always ready for a good time. If
she excelled in basketball and tennis rather than in
French and English, it was not because of lack of
ability, but rather because she could never find the
time to study. At Barry Manor her room had always
been the gathering place for friends and the
scene of many tea parties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so excited about this place we&rsquo;re going to,&rdquo;
she told Doris. &ldquo;When do we leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow, if that isn&rsquo;t rushing you off too soon.
Uncle Ward is going out of town to raise money for
some charity&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little hot air for a fresh air fund,&rdquo; Mr. Force
interposed. &ldquo;A speech at the Rotary Club, one at
the church, and one at the Chamber of Commerce.
That&rsquo;s the opening day&rsquo;s program and it will be
about the same for the next month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless we leave for Locked Gates tomorrow,
we&rsquo;ll be left here by ourselves,&rdquo; Doris explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, by all means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you would want to start right away.
Dave said he would take us down in his roadster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a wonderful time, too!&rdquo; Kitty declared
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Doris nodded in agreement. In spite of what
Dave and Jake had said concerning Locked Gates,
she little dreamed of the adventure that lay before
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I just hope we have a real interesting session at
this place,&rdquo; continued Kitty gleefully, &ldquo;something
to tell the sorority about when we return to school
in the fall. Just fancy the crowd gathered around
us while we tell in a solemn voice the mysteries of
Locked Gates. I really hope something exciting
does happen to us, Dory,&rdquo; she exulted, as the roadster
swung around the corner, throwing her little
hat a bit more rakishly over one eye. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be disappointed
if it doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty, you are very brave just at present. Be
sure to keep up your present demeanor as we go
forth on our big adventure,&rdquo; admonished Doris
Force thoughtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">LOCKED GATES</span></h2>
<p>Kitty Norris had always been popular at school,
for she had a charming way of fitting into things.
Before she had been in Chilton an hour she felt
perfectly acquainted with Wardell Force, Mrs.
Mallow, Marshmallow and even Jake. Marshmallow
in particular took an immediate liking to
her and tried to monopolize her time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Kitty admitted that night, after
the girls had gone to their room, &ldquo;I sort of like
Marshall. He&rsquo;s so jolly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were quite taken by him,&rdquo; Doris
laughed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain to see Marshmallow has
taken a distinct liking to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris Force!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he has. Too bad he&rsquo;s so fat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a little stout,&rdquo; Kitty admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stout!&rdquo; Doris teased. &ldquo;How you have fallen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then I guess we&rsquo;re even,&rdquo; Kitty retorted.
&ldquo;You and Dave&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better be tumbling into bed,&rdquo; Doris interposed
hastily, &ldquo;or we won&rsquo;t be rested for our trip
tomorrow to Locked Gates.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Shortly after eleven o&rsquo;clock the following morning,
David Chamberlin called for the girls. Wardell
Force had of necessity taken an early train out
of the city, so there were only Jake, Marshmallow
and his mother to see them off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I were going,&rdquo; the plump youth murmured
enviously. &ldquo;Still, I have a sneaking notion it won&rsquo;t
be as jolly as you think down there at Locked
Gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll liven the place up,&rdquo; Doris declared
lightly.</p>
<p>Dave drove rather slowly, for neither he nor the
girls were eager to reach Rumson before the middle
of the afternoon. Doris and Kitty had gone to
great pains to prepare and pack a dainty lunch and
the three planned to stop some place along the
road for a picnic.</p>
<p>The day was unpleasantly warm and sultry. As
they took the main highway leading to Rumson,
Doris glanced anxiously at the scattered clouds
which were to be seen overhead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it doesn&rsquo;t rain and spoil our picnic,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think it will,&rdquo; Dave replied. &ldquo;The
sky is almost clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true that the sun was shining brightly,
but the sky had a dull appearance which Doris
did not like. However, as they motored along
enjoying the scenery, she forgot the matter completely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to get hungry,&rdquo; Dave announced
as it approached noon. &ldquo;We may as well begin to
look for a good place to stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently, Doris caught sight of an attractive
grove of trees ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the spot!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Cool
and shady and not too close to the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave parked the roadster just off the highway
and they took the hamper over to the grove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a dandy place,&rdquo; Kitty approved. &ldquo;I believe
there&rsquo;s a spring back there among the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave had been gazing thoughtfully toward a
sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that we should have stopped here,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Doris demanded quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We seem to have camped pretty close to the
entrance to the Glenville Roadhouse. However,
we&rsquo;re not on their property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What difference does it make?&rdquo; Kitty asked
innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Dave hesitated. &ldquo;This roadhouse
doesn&rsquo;t have much of a reputation, so I&rsquo;ve been
told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had better leave,&rdquo; Doris suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have everything all spread out,&rdquo; Kitty complained,
&ldquo;and this is the nicest grove we&rsquo;ve passed.
We&rsquo;re not even within sight of the roadhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it will do any harm to stay here,&rdquo;
Dave agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon be on our way again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>They sat down and began to eat luncheon.
There were thin sandwiches, ice-cold lemonade,
salad, pickles, and some of Mrs. Mallow&rsquo;s delicious
cookies and cake. Long before they had finished,
they realized that their imaginations had been more
ambitious than their appetites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat another thing,&rdquo; Kitty groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame to let these sandwiches go to
waste,&rdquo; Dave excused himself, selecting one made
of chicken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet you can&rsquo;t take it all in one bite,&rdquo; Doris
dared him on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little thing like that? Just watch me!
Why you&rsquo;re not looking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true that Doris was no longer interested.
A red roadster had turned into the lane leading to
the roadhouse, and she had caught a glimpse of the
driver&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that same man we saw at the aviation
meet!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Evidently, he intends to
have luncheon at the roadhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must not care much for his reputation,&rdquo; Dave
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, I don&rsquo;t like this place,&rdquo; Doris said
quietly. &ldquo;Now that we&rsquo;ve finished eating, let&rsquo;s be
on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right-o!&rdquo; Dave sprang up and began to pack
the dishes into the hamper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>As he placed the basket into the rear of the
roadster he surveyed the sky and frowned
slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beginning to look more like rain than it
did,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;d better make
full steam ahead or we may get caught in a storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty and Doris did not hear, for their attention
had been attracted to a little brown dog which
stood in the roadway regarding them with wistful,
friendly eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t he cute!&rdquo; Doris exclaimed. &ldquo;Here,
doggie! Come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little animal first backed timidly away and
then, as the girls continued to coax, hesitated, and
finally came a few steps toward them, wagging his
tail in a friendly way. As Doris stooped to pat
him on the head he gave a pleased bark, and raising
up on his hind legs, eagerly offered her his right
paw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows tricks,&rdquo; Doris declared. &ldquo;Oh, I
wonder who owns him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks to me like a stray dog,&rdquo; Dave told her.
&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t any collar or license. The dog catcher
will likely get him before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I can help it!&rdquo; Doris declared. &ldquo;If he
doesn&rsquo;t belong to anyone, we can take him with
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will the Misses Gates say when you come
dragging him in?&rdquo; Dave asked with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they won&rsquo;t care. He&rsquo;s such a darling!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we name him?&rdquo; Kitty questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call him Wags,&rdquo; Doris exclaimed impulsively.
&ldquo;The name seems appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wags had no objection to entering the car and
snuggled down comfortably between the two girls.
With an anxious glance at the sky, Dave started
the engine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a big storm is rolling up,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The girls had been so interested in Wags that
they had paid scant attention to the clouds, but
now as Doris looked about, she was alarmed. The
air was oppressive and not a breath of wind was
stirring. Heavy black clouds had loomed up in
the west and rapidly were spreading over the entire
sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can get you to Locked Gates before it
strikes us,&rdquo; Dave said grimly, as he shifted gears
and stepped heavily on the gas pedal. &ldquo;Hold
tight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The roadster fairly shot down the road. As the
figures crept upwards on the tape of the speedometer,
Doris and Kitty clung to each other. Not
until the car began to rock and weave on the road,
did Dave reduce his speed and then only slightly.
However, he held the roadster steady and handled
the wheel with such a sure hand, that the girls had
confidence in his driving.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>It was the appearance of the sky which frightened
them. The sun had been entirely blotted
from sight, and though it was mid-afternoon, it
seemed nearly as dark as night. Dave snapped on
the headlights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you to Locked Gates before the storm
breaks,&rdquo; he announced in relief as they rounded a
sharp curve and came within sight of Rumson.
&ldquo;Fortunately, the place is right at the edge of
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later, he brought the car to a
groaning halt in front of the old Gates estate. In
the gathering darkness the girls caught but a
glimpse of the large, rambling house which was set
back some distance from the road, but that was
sufficient to assure them that it was gloomy and
forbidding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; Dave said briskly. &ldquo;Nice place
for a murder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; Doris murmured. &ldquo;You make my hair
stand on end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost wish we hadn&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; Kitty said
nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, everything&rsquo;s all right. I was only joking.&rdquo;
Dave sprang from the car and went over to try the
double gates which barred the entrance. &ldquo;Just as
I thought! Locked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how are we to get in?&rdquo; Doris questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an entrance at the rear. Guess these
gates are always kept locked. We&rsquo;ll try the other
gate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>Driving the roadster down a side street, he found
the back entrance and helped the girls to alight.
As he picked up their suitcases to take them to the
door, Doris glanced again at the storm clouds. A
streak of lightning flashed across the sky, and she
knew that unless Dave started back at once, he
would be caught in the rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother to take us to the door,&rdquo; she commanded.
&ldquo;Start for Chilton this minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to leave you here until I know
everything is O. K.,&rdquo; he protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a step to the door, Dave. Be a good
boy and don&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since you insist, I will start, because it
looks like a storm and the roads may get slippery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastily the three said goodbye and Dave sprang
into the roadster. He slammed the door shut and
was gone before the girls had managed to unfasten
the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does look spooky,&rdquo; Kitty quavered.</p>
<p>Doris laughed uncertainly. She managed to
open the gate and it swung back on creaking hinges.
A sudden breath of wind struck her face and went
whistling through the trees.</p>
<p>The house, half-hidden by shrubbery, was
shrouded in deepest gloom, and no light glimmered
from the windows. Doris hesitated as she picked
up her suitcase. Kitty held back, and even Wags
seemed reluctant to venture down the path.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Kitty,&rdquo; Doris admonished, &ldquo;Everything
is all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, a gust of wind whined through the
trees, and to the girls it sounded strangely like the
wailing of a human being in distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t like it here,&rdquo; Kitty murmured
timidly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of, Kit. Just follow
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carrying their heavy suitcases, the girls groped
their way down the path. It was so dark now that
they could not see where they were going and frequently
brushed against shrubbery. Wags had
disappeared.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Kitty gave a frightened cry as she
stumbled over the root of a tree. Catching Doris&rsquo;s
arm to save herself from a bad fall, she permitted
her pocketbook to slip from her hand. It opened
as it struck the ground, and the contents spilled in
every direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look what I&rsquo;ve done now!&rdquo; Kitty wailed.</p>
<p>Doris set her suitcase down and helped her chum
search for the things she had lost. They found a
pencil, a compact and a number of bills, when another
flash of lightning momentarily illumined the
path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the rest,&rdquo; Kitty said nervously.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found everything except a quarter, and I&rsquo;ll
look for that tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>They continued on up the path and came to the
old mansion. The place appeared dark and deserted
and Kitty would have retreated, had not
Doris gripped her firmly by the arm. Bravely,
she lifted the old-fashioned knocker.</p>
<p>Huddled together on the veranda, the girls
waited. When no one came to admit them, Doris
again knocked. Just as she was beginning to think
that it was no use, they heard a heavy step. Then
the door opened and a man, bearing an oil light,
peered out at them.</p>
<p>Before either Doris or Kitty could explain their
mission, there came an unexpected yelp. To their
horror, Wags, suddenly appearing from beneath a
lilac bush, rushed past them straight at the man in
the doorway, striking him with such force that he
toppled him over.</p>
<p>A heavy peal of thunder resounded as the man
slumped to the floor in a queer sort of kneeling
position which, at any other time, would have been
provokingly funny to Doris Force and her chum.
But this was serious business and such a dilemma!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wags!&rdquo; shouted Doris, &ldquo;Come here, come
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog bounded into the kitchen, around a
table, sniffed at some cake placed dangerously near
the table edge, madly rushed to a basket of potatoes
throwing the potatoes in all directions over the
smooth floor, and then at the call from Doris
headed again towards the doorway with a dish
towel playfully dragging between his teeth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, puppy, here!&rdquo; commanded Kitty, catching
her breath and setting down her suitcase, while
Doris tried to catch a corner of the linen as the dog
jumped over the bewildered man, pulling the cloth
over the man&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help, oh, ouch, help!&rdquo; shouted the man. &ldquo;Call
your mutt off! Help! Let me get up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wags, doggie, doggie, come here!&rdquo; pleaded
Doris, as she realized the man was now in no mood
to be trifled with.</p>
<p>She and Kitty decided that they now must command
their new pet&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">A STRANGE RECEPTION</span></h2>
<p>Frantically, Doris and Kitty called to Wags
and in response to their commands he reluctantly
returned to them. The man who had fallen
scrambled to his feet, and stood glaring angrily at
the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m dreadfully sorry,&rdquo; Doris apologized.
&ldquo;Wags isn&rsquo;t really vicious. He was just playing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Playing!&rdquo; the man snapped. &ldquo;You call that
playing!&rdquo; As Wags again came toward him he
raised his foot to kick him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Doris pleaded. &ldquo;I tell you it was an
accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She caught the dog up in her arms and held him
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want here anyway?&rdquo; the man
asked rudely.</p>
<p>The first drops of rain were beginning to fall
and as a vivid streak of lightning flashed above the
house, the girls cringed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, may we come in?&rdquo; Doris begged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Silently the man held the door open for them
but he scowled as they passed through. They entered
a large kitchen. Before they had time to
take stock of it, a stout, slovenly woman who was
mopping the floor, bore wrathfully down upon
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t come in here with that dog!&rdquo; she
told them. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;ve just finished mopping
up this big ark of a kitchen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chilled by this reception, the girls hastily backed
toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it you want?&rdquo; the woman asked, less
harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came to see the Misses Gates,&rdquo; Doris explained.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re expecting us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; A peculiar expression flashed over the
woman&rsquo;s face. She was silent for an instant and
then she said: &ldquo;You came to the wrong door.
This is our quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cora Sully. I take care of the house. This is
my husband, Henry, and I&rsquo;ll tell you right now
there ain&rsquo;t a lazier man alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat embarrassed at such brutal frankness,
Doris and Kitty continued to edge toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go around to the side door and I&rsquo;ll let you in
proper, else the old maids&rsquo;ll be put out.&rdquo; Then
she added more gently: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not much used to
company here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the girls were about to close the door behind
them, she called shrilly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t take the dog in!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>Still carrying their suitcases, and with Wags
trotting at their heels, Doris and Kitty made their
way toward the side door. It was beginning to
rain hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a horrible woman!&rdquo; Kitty shuddered.
&ldquo;Now, what can we do with Wags?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let him run wild in the storm, that&rsquo;s
certain. I have an idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the shelter of the side veranda
and Doris set her suitcase down and began to unfasten
the strap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; Kitty demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tie Wags under the porch. He&rsquo;ll
be out of the rain there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mean of that woman not to let us take him
in,&rdquo; Kitty said.</p>
<p>She helped her chum fix the dog, but they were
forced to drag him under the porch by main force,
for he was reluctant to leave them. By the time
they had fastened him securely in his shelter, they
were thoroughly drenched themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sights we are!&rdquo; Doris declared. &ldquo;I
wonder if that woman ever will let us in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here she comes now,&rdquo; Kitty said in a low tone.</p>
<p>The door swung open and Cora, wearing a clean
white apron which she had donned for the occasion,
ushered them into a long hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right this way,&rdquo; she directed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>They followed her into a spacious living room,
bright and cheerful, but furnished in rather prim
and old-fashioned style. A fire was burning in the
grate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two young ladies to see you,&rdquo; Cora announced.</p>
<p>The Misses Gates promptly arose and, putting
aside their sewing, eagerly came forward to greet
the girls. Cora took their suitcases and wraps and
left them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad you came,&rdquo; one of the ladies said
in a soft, sweet voice. &ldquo;When this storm gathered
so quickly, we were afraid you might be caught in
it.&rdquo; She smiled apologetically. &ldquo;Our home isn&rsquo;t
as modern as it once was, but Azalea and I will try
to make you comfortable here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she sank back into the restful depths of a big
chair, Doris had an opportunity to study the two
sisters.</p>
<p>Iris and Azalea quite obviously were twins, for
they looked alike and they dressed identically.
Their voices, too, were similar&mdash;low, musical and
soft. They looked rather frail and delicate, Doris
thought, and their faces were finely chiseled like
that of a cameo. They wore simple, long, white
cotton dresses. Had it not been for their snow
white hair, Doris would not have guessed that they
had long since left their youth behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>If the girls had been disappointed at their first
reception, they no longer had any doubt of their
welcome. Azalea and Iris set them at ease by
maintaining a pleasant, light conversation. It was
apparent to Doris that they were both well educated,
though they seemed to take little interest in
modern-day topics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they know much about what has
been going on in the world for the last ten years,&rdquo;
Doris told herself.</p>
<p>Before fifteen minutes had elapsed, she found
herself quite captivated by the two ladies, and
Kitty, too, had forgotten her former uneasiness.</p>
<p>As the afternoon advanced, the girls found themselves
more and more comfortable, looking forward
to a pleasant visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt you wondered why we invited you
here,&rdquo; Iris said after a time, addressing Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I did,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story. Azalea and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice trailed off as Cora Sully appeared in
the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supper is served,&rdquo; she announced.</p>
<p>Iris arose to lead the way to the dining room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story must wait,&rdquo; she said with a smile.
&ldquo;I know you girls are far more interested in food
just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a bit hungry,&rdquo; acknowledged Doris with a
pleasant smile, as she and Kitty followed the twins
into the next room where Cora was putting the
finishing touches to the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Kitty kept close to her chum. Doris caught her
eye. In a whisper she heard Kitty ask her about
the dog outside, as she motioned toward the food&mdash;Kitty
wanted Wags to be remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; signalled Doris, as the group took seats
about the table.</p>
<p>But would the dog wait?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">A VISITOR</span></h2>
<p>Supper at the mansion was always a rather stiff
and formal affair, but on this evening the tension
was somewhat relaxed. The Misses Gates chatted
pleasantly with the girls, making them feel
entirely at their ease.</p>
<p>The table had been laid with an elaborately embroidered
tablecloth, of good quality but slightly
yellowed with age. The dishes, the cut glass, and
the silver were of the best. Two tall candles in
pewter holders lighted the room. Cora Sully,
fairly presentable in white cap and apron, brought
the food in from the kitchen, but she served it in
an indifferent fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cora really is an excellent cook,&rdquo; Iris said half
apologetically, when the woman had returned to
the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; Doris agreed quickly.</p>
<p>She had no fault to find with the supper, for the
creamed chicken was delicious, the biscuits light,
the salad crisp and fresh. It was only that she
had taken a dislike to Cora and wondered why
the Misses Gates kept such a slouchy, sullen
woman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Sully has been with us for some time,&rdquo;
Iris continued. &ldquo;She was the daughter of our
former dressmaker, but she married a man that
was no good. Undoubtedly he means well but he
is shiftless, and finds it hard to obtain work. We
took them both in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Doris murmured.</p>
<p>She scarcely knew what to reply, and Kitty was
leaving the burden of the conversation to her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sully cleared away the dishes and appeared
with the dessert, a steaming rich pudding which
she placed before Azalea, who served it upon individual
plates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iris and I seldom indulge ourselves when we are
here alone,&rdquo; Azalea remarked, &ldquo;but we remember
how young girls like sweets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you have gone to a great deal of
trouble on our account,&rdquo; Doris said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Azalea assured her. &ldquo;It is a pleasure
to have you here. We have so few visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to Doris, who chanced to be watching
Mrs. Sully, that an irritated expression passed over
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She</i> doesn&rsquo;t like it because we are here,&rdquo; Doris
thought. &ldquo;Probably thinks we&rsquo;ll make her more
work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She picked up her dessert spoon, but before she
could start eating her pudding, there came an unexpected
interruption. A loud barking and growling
grated upon the ears of the diners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>Doris and Kitty exchanged guilty glances. It
was Wags!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious!&rdquo; Iris murmured. &ldquo;What can be the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Embarrassed, Kitty looked down at her plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry,&rdquo; Doris apologized, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid
it must be Wags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wags?&rdquo; Azalea asked, a glimmer of amusement
in her eyes.</p>
<p>Doris nodded unhappily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the cutest little brown dog you ever saw&mdash;I
know you&rsquo;ll just love him! Kitty and I picked
him up on the road this afternoon and brought him
along. We didn&rsquo;t want to leave him out in the
storm, so we tied him up under the porch. I don&rsquo;t
know what set him off like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before either of the women could reply, Wags
again let out a series of savage yelps and Doris
heard the sound of a man&rsquo;s voice. Hastily, she
pushed back her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what is the matter,&rdquo; she said, excusing
herself.</p>
<p>Hurrying to the door, she opened it and stared
straight into the face of the man who had made
such a disturbance at the aviation meet! Wags,
still securely tied under the porch, had taken exception
to the appearance of the stranger and continued
to bark excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Wags!&rdquo; Doris commanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s your mutt, eh?&rdquo; the stranger asked
unpleasantly. &ldquo;Vicious dogs shouldn&rsquo;t be at
large!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris stifled a sharp retort. Now that she saw
the man at close range she was more unfavorably
impressed than before. He was dressed in a new
suit of loud pattern, and carried a cane. His face
was hard and cold and his eyes had an unpleasant
way of boring into one.</p>
<p>Before Doris could recover from her surprise, the
Misses Gates came rushing into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I recognized your voice,&rdquo; Iris murmured,
self-consciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were wondering if you would come tonight,&rdquo;
Azalea added, a tell-tale blush creeping
over her pale cheeks.</p>
<p>The stranger bestowed upon each a smile which
to Doris seemed to fairly drip sentiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think I could stay away from two such
charming young ladies?&rdquo; he asked in a strangely
softened voice.</p>
<p>Kitty, who had followed the Misses Gates into
the hall, looked at her chum in disgust. Azalea
and Iris saw nothing amiss. One of them took his
hat and stick, the other his dripping coat.</p>
<p>Miss Azalea gazed admiringly at the cane which
he bestowed upon her with all the grace of a
sleight-of-hand performer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asked in self-satisfied tones as
he twirled the stick jauntily before handing it to
the enraptured hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, aren&rsquo;t you clever, Ronald?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he shrugged his shoulders as if to appear
very modest, &ldquo;they do say I&rsquo;m a good entertainer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iris shook the raindrops from his topcoat solicitously
and hung it up to dry on the antique coat
rack in the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, I brought that cane over with me
from Monte Carlo. That was my lucky day. My
side of the argument was right, as usual, so the
cane fell to my lot. I told the chap at the Casino
how the play of a friend of mine would come out,
and of course it came out as I said it would. You
understand, ladies, that it was just a friendly little
bet, nothing to disturb one&rsquo;s conscience,&rdquo; hoping
that these last words of his would vindicate any
doubts in their minds as to his moral standing. &ldquo;A
friendly little wager,&rdquo; he concluded, as with a wave
of his hand he dismissed the subject entirely.</p>
<p>For a minute or two they were so excited and
flustered that they entirely forgot the presence of
the two girls. Recovering herself, Azalea turned
to introduce them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris,&rdquo; she said, beaming happily, &ldquo;I am sure
this will be a pleasant surprise for you. May I
present Ronald Trent, the son of your long-lost
uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pleased to meet &rsquo;chu,&rsquo;&rdquo; the stranger mumbled.</p>
<p>Doris managed a perfunctory reply, but she
really was too stunned to consider what she was
saying. She could not believe that she had heard
correctly, and after Kitty had acknowledged the
introduction, she turned to Azalea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I understand you to say Mr. Trent is a
relative of mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, your cousin,&rdquo; the man broke in, before
Azalea could answer. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, kid. You
and me will hit it off together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris could not trust herself to reply. She
glanced toward Kitty and saw the puzzled look in
her eyes. What must her chum think!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man my cousin!&rdquo; she thought dismally.
&ldquo;Oh, dear, I wish I hadn&rsquo;t found it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we had a heavy shower, girlies,&rdquo; boomed
the new arrival as he adjusted his glaring tie carefully,
&ldquo;but I found a chummy roadhouse with a
big welcome during the heaviest thunder. I certainly
enjoy good company.&rdquo; He smacked his lips
thoughtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>Kitty carefully kept her eyes turned away from
her embarrassed chum. This was an unexpected
turn to events. She was more surprised and worried
at meeting this flashy stranger than she cared
to have the group know. Reared in a refined and
cultured environment, she feared her family might
call her away at once, if they should become aware
of the fact that such a man as this one were to
spend any time in the company of the girls. She
pictured the faculty at Barry Manor as being highly
shocked and amazed should anybody tell them that
these two pupils were spending their vacation in a
place where they were obliged to associate with a
person of the type of Ronald Trent. Would she
have to desert her friend and leave for home on account
of the sudden appearance of this relative of
Doris?</p>
<p>Kitty pondered this matter seriously in her mind.</p>
<p>Doris was equally worried in her own way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">A CONVERSATION OVERHEARD</span></h2>
<p>The Misses Gates escorted Ronald Trent to the
living room, forgetting in their excitement that
supper had not been finished. Doris and Kitty
were too polite to mention that they had not had
their dessert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You girlies get prettier every day,&rdquo; the man
gushed, playfully straightening Iris&rsquo;s lace collar
and slyly giving Azalea&rsquo;s hand a squeeze.</p>
<p>Iris giggled, and her sister cast down her eyes in
confusion. Ronald Trent winked at Doris and
Kitty as much as to say: &ldquo;How easy they fall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iris and Azalea, unaware that they were appearing
in a slightly ridiculous light, continued to beam
and to blush, listening intently to every word
Ronald Trent said, and laughing at everything
which might be remotely interpreted as a joke.
Doris was completely disgusted at the way the man
was acting, and when he tried to cajole her into a
more friendly attitude, she could not hide her indifference.
Azalea and Iris did not notice how
quiet she was, but Ronald Trent was aware of her
attitude and frowned slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, girlie?&rdquo; he teased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Doris returned quietly.</p>
<p>She felt that if he continued to plague her she
surely would disgrace herself by saying something
which would offend the Gates sisters. How could
they like such a man? He was cheap and coarse
and obviously insincere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor things,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t
had much attention from men and it flatters them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tension was somewhat relieved when Iris
asked Kitty if she could sing or play the piano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the least musical,&rdquo; Kitty returned,
&ldquo;but Doris sings beautifully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon being urged to entertain the group, Doris
obediently went to the piano. After looking over
the music she selected a familiar piece, struck a few
chords, and began to sing. A hush fell over the
group, and even Ronald Trent, who was talking to
Iris, became quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely,&rdquo; Azalea murmured when she had finished.
&ldquo;You have a wonderful voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty keen,&rdquo; Ronald Trent agreed, &ldquo;but can&rsquo;t
you sing something livelier? I don&rsquo;t like them
church hymns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You call those songs church hymns?&rdquo; Doris
asked with an amused smile. &ldquo;Really, if you
want popular music, I can&rsquo;t oblige you. My
teacher permits me to sing only classical.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>After she had left the piano, Ronald Trent
launched into a lengthy tale concerning his recent
exploits in South America. In many particulars
the story did not hang together, and Doris and
Kitty were bored. Iris and Azalea were flattering
listeners and, whenever he showed signs of pausing,
urged him on with interested questions.</p>
<p>As Doris listened, doubts began to form in her
mind. It seemed incomprehensible that this boasting,
crude stranger could really be her cousin.
There must be a mistake, she told herself. Ronald
Trent was <i>not</i> a relative; of that she felt certain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, girlies, isn&rsquo;t it about time you trundled
off to your little beds?&rdquo; he asked, looking insinuatingly
at Doris and Kitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine you girls are tired,&rdquo; Azalea murmured.
&ldquo;If you like, I can have Cora show you to
your room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re not sleepy yet,&rdquo; Kitty said mischievously.</p>
<p>Ronald Trent fairly glared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run along now,&rdquo; he said lightly, but with a
look which warned the girls he expected to be
obeyed. &ldquo;I have some business to talk over with
Iris and Azalea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iris rang for Cora, and the girls reluctantly followed
her upstairs through a long hall and down a
number of steps into a wing which branched off to
the right. Cora showed them their room and left
them alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if we&rsquo;re to be off in this wing all by
ourselves,&rdquo; Kitty said uneasily. &ldquo;This place is too
spooky to suit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room was large and austere with long
mirrors and an old-fashioned four-poster bed and
dresser. Several rag rugs were scattered over the
bare floor. Double windows looked down over the
side veranda and the branches of a sprawling maple
tree brushed against the panes.</p>
<p>As a precautionary measure Kitty looked under
the bed and peeped into the closet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that man terrible?&rdquo; Doris said, sitting
down on the edge of the bed. &ldquo;And the way he
sent us to bed just as though we were infants! Do
you think he really could be a cousin of mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how he could be,&rdquo; Kitty comforted.
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look or act like any of your relatives
that I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope not! Wonder what he wants of
Iris and Azalea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something he didn&rsquo;t want us to hear, that&rsquo;s
certain. Say, where is he from, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some place about four hundred miles from
here&mdash;Cloudy Cove, I think he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he drives that far every few days to see
Azalea and Iris? It looks fishy to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; Doris agreed. &ldquo;The Misses
Gates are lovely ladies&mdash;far too good for that loud
creature&mdash;but at the same time they&rsquo;re scarcely the
type a man would drive four hundred miles to see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t care a whit about them. You can
tell that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they undressed, the girls continued to discuss
Ronald Trent and to make disparaging remarks.
Then Kitty jumped into bed and Doris put out the
light. Snuggling down into the covers, they shivered
a bit as the wind rattled the window pane.
They could almost imagine that in the pitch dark
room someone was slowly creeping toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to stay here very long,&rdquo; Kitty whispered.
&ldquo;Folks are so funny. Even Henry and
Cora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m eager to find out why they sent for me,&rdquo;
Doris whispered in return. &ldquo;It looks to me as
though there&rsquo;s something strange going on here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Save for the moaning of the wind, the old house
was quiet, and presently the girls heard the front
door slam shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my illustrious cousin departing,&rdquo;
Doris murmured.</p>
<p>A few minutes later they heard two doors close
farther down the hall and knew that Azalea and
Iris had retired.</p>
<p>The girls closed their eyes and tried to go to
sleep, but the brushing of the branches against the
windows, and the weird sounds made by the wind,
kept them in a state of nervous suspense. Then,
just as Doris was dozing off, she heard a low
whimpering moan from the yard below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wags!&rdquo; she whispered to Kitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll stop,&rdquo; her chum suggested.</p>
<p>But Wags did not stop. He continued to
whimper until the girls were afraid he would disturb
the entire household.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing!&rdquo; Doris sympathized. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out
there all alone in a strange place. I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s
lonesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last, unable to bear it any longer, she slipped
out of bed and began to dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; Kitty whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to bring him up here for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cora will just about kill you, if she catches
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sneak down so quietly no one will hear me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to stay here alone while you&rsquo;re
gone, Dory. It&rsquo;s too scarey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh! It&rsquo;s too far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris had finished dressing and now, without
making a light, she moved cautiously toward the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be gone long,&rdquo; Kitty pleaded in a whisper.
&ldquo;If Wags lets out a yelp while you&rsquo;re bringing
him upstairs, we&rsquo;re sunk!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>Quietly opening the door, Doris stood and listened.
The old mansion was quiet save for the
whistling of the wind and the rattling of doors and
windows. Hesitating a moment, she noiselessly
stole down the hallway. She was not afraid of
being heard for she knew Azalea and Iris had
rooms in the other wing.</p>
<p>At the head of the stairway she halted in astonishment.
Below her she caught the glimmer of an
oil lamp. To her further amazement she saw two
men sitting at the table and instantly recognized
them as Ronald Trent and Henry Sully!</p>
<p>Doris&rsquo;s first impulse was to retreat. Then,
realizing that she was standing in the dark and
could not be seen, although she could plainly see
what the others were about, she was tempted to
remain. Instinctively, she had sensed that all was
not as it should be. She distinctly remembered
hearing Ronald Trent leave the house before the
Misses Gates had retired. Why, then, had Henry
Sully admitted him again and so quietly that no
one had been the wiser?</p>
<p>She listened intently so as not to miss a word
the men were saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any mail today, Hank?&rdquo; she heard Ronald
Trent mutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but we&rsquo;ll git something soon, I hope,&rdquo;
Henry answered so low that Doris scarcely caught
the words. &ldquo;Takes a while to git mail from the oil
fields, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wish things would start breaking our way for
a change,&rdquo; Ronald said. &ldquo;First thing we know
that smart-looking Force kid will throw a wrench
into the works and ruin our plans. I need money
bad, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t the only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody does,&rdquo; growled Trent softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand this outfit much longer,&rdquo; mumbled
Henry dejectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the crowd in town treating you?&rdquo; inquired
Trent, a bit maliciously. &ldquo;The town officials
haven&rsquo;t decided on a clean-up week, have
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw, that&rsquo;s all right. But this law-abidin&rsquo;
flock make me tired. Too many females pokin&rsquo;
around&mdash;just too many,&rdquo; muttered Henry disgustedly,
taking out his watch, and winding the
stem thoughtfully, tilting his head to one side in
an attitude of alertness. The hour was growing
late.</p>
<p>Doris shrank back, but there was no need. They
were entirely unaware of her nearness.</p>
<p>Ronald Trent laughed suggestively. This made
Doris&rsquo;s cheeks burn with embarrassment as he said,
&ldquo;Gee, that bunch of flowers smell good to me! I
love the ladies, especially the pretty girlies, Henry.
I&rsquo;m not so hard to be friends with,&rdquo; the egotist
mused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a swell dresser, too, everything the
dames like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry envied him his position with the Misses
Gates, it was plain to be seen, as he accepted the
statement with a nod of approval.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>There was a pause as Ronald Trent took out a
wallet and looked over its contents.</p>
<p>Doris waited in the dark hallway, unable to see
the contents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old dames are shutting down a bit,&rdquo; Ronald
went on. &ldquo;I had to play up to &rsquo;em tonight
and got only two hundred at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad the old gals got that letter off to the
red-head. That was one you missed, Trent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reference to her made Doris decide to creep
a step or two nearer. She had heard enough to
convince her that Henry and Ronald were conspiring
against Azalea and Iris, the two trusting,
flower-like ladies!</p>
<p>She strained forward to catch more of the conversation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">MEMORIES</span></h2>
<p>However, Doris was to learn no more that night,
for as she moved softly down the stairs the two
men pushed back their chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be gettin&rsquo; out of here before those
old gals find out what we&rsquo;re doing,&rdquo; he warned.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you out the back way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They moved on to the kitchen and Doris, made
bold by her knowledge of the underhanded scheme,
came down into the living room. She heard the
back door close as Ronald Trent hurriedly departed.
A moment later, as the gate creaked,
Wags gave another savage yelp.</p>
<p>Not until she heard Henry starting up the back
stairs to his own quarters, did Doris dare venture
to the door. Waiting until everything was still
again, she quietly let herself out of doors.</p>
<p>Wags whimpered joyfully as she stooped down
to unfasten him, and lifted up his paws. Doris
picked him up, and holding him close, stole back
into the house. She closed and locked the door
behind her and listened. The coast seemed
clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare bark!&rdquo; she whispered to Wags.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Tiptoeing up the stairway, she anxiously wondered
if she could reach her room without being
discovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Azalea and Iris are probably asleep by this
time,&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>In this supposition she was not correct. The
Misses Gates were at that moment lying wide
awake in their adjoining rooms in the left wing, recalling
vivid memories of their girlhood when each
hoped to be the bride of the handsome John Trent.</p>
<p>Only a few close friends had understood why
Doris&rsquo;s uncle had gone away without marrying
either of the twins, for by turns he had appeared
in love with each of them. Some people had jokingly
remarked that he could not tell them apart
and that this was his reason for giving them up.
At any rate, he had never been able to choose between
them and had gone away, leaving heart-breaks
behind. For Azalea and Iris the locked
gates at the front entrance to the mansion were
symbolic of a past which could never be forgotten.</p>
<p>With the passing of the years, the Misses Gates
clung tightly to their memories, and the appearance
of John Trent&rsquo;s son had only served to freshen
them. Perhaps in Ronald Trent they saw their
lover of old. At any rate, they doted upon him
and were flattered by his extravagant compliments.
Believing that he was indeed the son of John Trent,
they could not see his cheapness or his crude devices
for gaining their favor. They regarded him
indulgently, as a mother might her son.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Shut away from the world by their own wishes,
Azalea and Iris lived only for their dreams.
Wickedness was to them nebulous and unreal.
They had trusted Ronald Trent because it was in
their nature to trust.</p>
<p>As Doris stole quietly up the stairway with
Wags snuggled in her arms, her thoughts were
bitter. What right had Ronald Trent to ingratiate
himself with Azalea and Iris, only to trick
them? Obviously, his motive was money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t get away with anything if I can help
it!&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<p>As if to punctuate the thought, she unthinkingly
gave Wags a tiny squeeze. He promptly yelped.
Alarmed, Doris stopped and listened, but she could
hear no one moving in the house. Quieting Wags,
she continued up the stairs and down the long dark
hall to her bedroom.</p>
<p>Letting herself in, she dropped Wags on the bed
with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you never were coming,&rdquo; Kitty
whispered. &ldquo;What in the world made you take
so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of things,&rdquo; Doris told her impressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was scared to death here by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was sort of scarey down where I was too, Kit.
Listen! I have the most astonishing news!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>In a few terse sentences she then told her chum
all she had overheard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the mean old scamp!&rdquo; Kitty exclaimed.
&ldquo;So you think he is after their money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose they have a lot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I should think so. This
house must be worth plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty and Doris were both ignorant of real estate
values and did not know that if Locked Gates were
placed upon the auction block, it would bring only
a comparatively small sum. The house was not
modern and had fallen into a general state of
dilapidation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least, I&rsquo;m pretty sure that man isn&rsquo;t my
cousin,&rdquo; Doris declared, &ldquo;although Henry Sully
did call him Trent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew there was something wrong with that
man the minute I saw him,&rdquo; Kitty insisted.</p>
<p>Doris had finished undressing and slipped into
bed. Wags snuggled down between the girls and
they permitted him to remain, for his presence
made them less afraid of the unseen dangers of the
old mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean to do now that you&rsquo;ve discovered
that those men are plotting against Azalea
and Iris?&rdquo; Kitty asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Doris admitted doubtfully. &ldquo;If
they learn what we&rsquo;ve discovered, there is no telling
what they might do to us. They already suspect
that I may try to make trouble. They called
me a red-head! I&rsquo;ll show &rsquo;em a thing or two before
I get through!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell the twins what you have learned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not right away. I want to get all the proof I
can before I say anything to them. If I should
make a mistake, they never would forgive me.
You know, Kitty, I even hate to hear that man
Trent laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be honest with you, Dory, I do too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so insincere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Kitty. &ldquo;Whenever he bursts out
into one of those loud guffaws of his one just can&rsquo;t
help but feel that he is doing something for effect&mdash;that
there is not real honest effort back of anything
he is planning or doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment Wags, as if to comfort the two
girls and to protect them from sinister wiles of
those around them, stretched forth his little red
tongue and tried to bestow a wet kiss on an ear of
each of the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear little Waggsie, you are our friend, aren&rsquo;t
you, even though we are not sure of the rest of
them in this house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wags gave a yawn of contentment, and snuggled
closer between the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose this Trent does to earn
a living?&rdquo; ventured Kitty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine what he does, but he surely is
well dressed, and has a snappy car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave said that car was a special imported model
from France. They are very expensive&mdash;cost
plenty, besides the transportation charges from the
other side,&rdquo; replied Kitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Uncle John Trent was anything like
this Ronald. Perhaps Uncle Ward never mentioned
Ronald to me, because he was so loud and
coarse. However, if Uncle really never knew he
existed, he won&rsquo;t approve of him in our family
circle now. This is really a dreadful thing to discover,&rdquo;
and Doris sighed disconsolately, as she
pushed back her soft hair that was massed over the
pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Doris, I think we&rsquo;re in for an adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly looks like trouble after that conversation
I just overheard between Trent and
Henry,&rdquo; replied Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was surely lucky they didn&rsquo;t see you in the
dark hallway&mdash;that would have been unfortunate,&rdquo;
and Kitty drew the coverlet over her bare, white
arm, and shook her pillow into a more comfortable
position.</p>
<p>Wags snored contentedly as if bored with hearing
his bed-fellows chattering so late into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bit sleepy, Kitty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Neither am I,&rdquo; responded her chum; &ldquo;this has
been such an exciting and thrillingly adventurous
day, with your playing detective and getting information,
that I can&rsquo;t go to sleep. I&rsquo;m thinking
about it too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you suppose we&rsquo;ll hear why we are
here to visit?&rdquo; inquired Doris of Kitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe the Misses Gates will tell us soon,
and that will be helpful to place the motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far into the night the girls continued to talk, but
at length, from sheer weariness, they turned over
on their sides and tried to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope no one finds Wags here,&rdquo; Doris murmured
drowsily as she closed her eyes. &ldquo;We must wake
up early in the morning and get him out of the
house before any one is up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">A SORROWFUL ROMANCE</span></h2>
<p>Doris and Kitty fully intended to awaken early,
but when they did open their eyes the sun was
streaming brightly in at the windows and some one
was pounding on their door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; Doris murmured sleepily.</p>
<p>Cora Sully thrust her head in at the door and
glared at the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can get your breakfast in
bed?&rdquo; she demanded harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; Doris asked, sitting up and
nudging Kitty, as a signal for her to keep Wags
hidden under the covers.</p>
<p>Wags, however, had ideas of his own and at this
unfortunate moment he gave a smothered yelp and
pawed his way out from under the bed clothes.
He leaped to the floor and darted playfully toward
the housekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did that dog get in here?&rdquo; Cora asked
sharply. &ldquo;<i>You</i> brought him up here last night,&rdquo;
she accused Doris. &ldquo;You little sneak!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a sneak,&rdquo; Doris retorted. She had
been confused and ashamed at the untimely discovery
of her pet, but now that the housekeeper
had made such an uncalled for remark, she was
inclined to defend herself. &ldquo;We heard him barking
and were afraid he would awaken every one in
the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The explanation did not mollify the woman but
rather seemed to fan the flame of her wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are!&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;You just wanted
an excuse to prowl about the house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not!&rdquo; Doris refuted. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t seem
right to leave Wags out there all by himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had no right to bring him into the house!
I&rsquo;ll get him out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vengefully, Cora bore down upon the dog.</p>
<p>Wags, sensing that she was an enemy to be
avoided, whisked past her and leaped upon the bed.
Cora began to tear viciously at the blankets in an
effort to capture him.</p>
<p>By this time Kitty&rsquo;s arms had closed protectingly
upon the little dog, and Doris had jumped
out of bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take him downstairs just as soon as we
get dressed,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Wags hasn&rsquo;t done
any harm. Please don&rsquo;t get so excited about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you who&rsquo;s excited!&rdquo; Cora muttered.</p>
<p>She had completely lost control of her temper
and as Kitty rolled out on the opposite side of the
bed, she made another dive for Wags. By this
time Doris had lost all patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare touch my dog!&rdquo; she said
quietly. &ldquo;If you do, I&rsquo;ll call the Misses Gates!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>The mention of the old ladies produced a surprising
effect upon Cora. For the moment she
seemed to forget about the dog and her resentment
was turned upon Doris and Kitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re trying to get me in trouble, eh?&rdquo; she
demanded harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; Doris tried to explain.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not say anything to the Misses Gates, if
you&rsquo;ll go away and leave us alone. We didn&rsquo;t
mean to do any harm and we&rsquo;re sorry we brought
Wags up here, since it has caused you so much
worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora cast baleful glances upon the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had to come here interfering&mdash;&rdquo; they heard
her mutter wrathfully to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; Doris asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I heard you say something about us coming
here to interfere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With what could we interfere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora shifted her weight uneasily and looked confused.
She felt that she had said too much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be afraid of something,&rdquo; Doris observed
shrewdly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid!&rdquo; the housekeeper snapped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you
who ought to be afraid. Let me tell you a thing
or two. If you don&rsquo;t want to get into trouble,
you&rsquo;d better be starting back home!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>With that she flounced out of the room, leaving
Kitty and Doris to stare blankly after her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well did you ever?&rdquo; Kitty exclaimed. &ldquo;What
did she mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think she was threatening us,&rdquo; Doris said in
a low tone, listening to make certain that the
housekeeper had gone on down the hall. &ldquo;She was
excited and didn&rsquo;t know how much she was giving
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She undoubtedly thinks we&rsquo;re interfering with
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their plans, of course. Undoubtedly, Cora is
in on the scheme. We&rsquo;ll have to be careful not to
let her suspect that we know anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had better go home,&rdquo; Kitty suggested
doubtfully. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the way things
are happening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Kit, we don&rsquo;t want to go home now,&rdquo;
Doris protested. &ldquo;If we do, that horrid man will
get all of the Misses Gates&rsquo;s money. We must
help them if we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Kitty sighed. &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m
game if you are. We&rsquo;ll see it through to a finish.
Thank goodness we have Wags with us, only I
wish he were a bulldog so he could take a chunk
out of any one that tries to annoy us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wags isn&rsquo;t very popular now,&rdquo; Doris laughed,
&ldquo;and he&rsquo;s the sweetest little dog in the world. I
don&rsquo;t see how folks can help but like him. Hurry
up, and get that other shoe on, Kit, or we never
shall get downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hastily the girls finished dressing, and carried
Wags down to the porch where they once more tied
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing must be about starved,&rdquo; Doris said
sympathetically. &ldquo;After breakfast we&rsquo;ll see if we
can&rsquo;t get a bone for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Returning to the living room they found Azalea
and Iris waiting for them. Contritely, the girls
apologized for oversleeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t very late,&rdquo; Iris said kindly. &ldquo;Only
nine o&rsquo;clock and we seldom have breakfast before
eight-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were tired last night,&rdquo; Kitty declared, &ldquo;and
we spent a lot of time talking. We&rsquo;ll see that it
doesn&rsquo;t happen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; Azalea assured her
with a smile. &ldquo;We were young once and remember
how hard it was to get up early in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breakfast was waiting and the four went at once
to the dining room. As Cora served, she cast
sullen glances at the two girls, and this was not
lost upon them. Breakfast finished, Doris went
to the kitchen to ask for something to feed Wags.
As she had anticipated, the request met with a
storm of anger, but the timely appearance of Iris
caused Cora&rsquo;s manner to abruptly change. She
gave Doris a pan of scraps with a show of good
grace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;After you have fed your dog, you girls might
like to see the garden,&rdquo; Iris suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed we would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris left the pan of food at the side porch and
then, with Kitty and the Misses Gates, began a
tour of the yard. She glanced curiously toward
the locked gates at the front of the house and
wondered if either of the ladies would offer an explanation.</p>
<p>Iris had brought her garden shears with her, and
as they wandered about, she cut each of the girls a
gorgeous bouquet of roses. Presently they came
to a stone bench and a tiny lily pool and here they
paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How well I remember,&rdquo; Azalea murmured, half
to herself, as she sank down upon the bench to
rest, &ldquo;it was just at this time of year that Iris and
I first met John Trent. The roses were in bloom
then, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty and Doris exchanged quick glances, wondering
if Azalea was about to branch into the story
they had been waiting to hear. She remained
silent for several minutes, and when she spoke
again it was in a more matter-of-fact tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you wonder why we invited you here,
Doris. As I told you before, it is a long story, but
if you would like to hear it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I would!&rdquo; Doris assured her eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your uncle, John Trent, was a very fine young
man,&rdquo; Azalea began. &ldquo;He was handsome and
dashing&mdash;everything that a girl could wish for.
Frequently he called at our home and Iris and I
became very fond of him. Unfortunately, we
never knew which one he liked better as he seemed
devoted to both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It made us very unhappy,&rdquo; Iris took up the
story. &ldquo;You see, until John Trent came into our
lives we had never had a disagreement. We
dressed alike and we enjoyed the same things&mdash;we
were rather proud of being twins. After we
met John, things were entirely different. We
no longer wished to resemble each other. Vying
for his favor, we even refused to dress
alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though no mention was made of any bitter feeling,
Doris, reading deeply, guessed that the two
ladies had carried their rivalry to such an extent
that they had come to actually hate each other.
Undoubtedly, the affair had been the talk of the
town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally Father stepped in and took a hand,&rdquo;
Iris went on. &ldquo;He told John that he must marry
one of us before the end of the month or he would
forbid him to ever step inside the gate again. Oh,
it was dreadful!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>Here Iris&rsquo;s voice broke and she could not continue.
After a few minutes Azalea tried to take
up the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The days passed and still John could not
choose. Each hour was a nightmare to Iris and to
me. We knew the townsfolk were aware of everything
and were laughing behind our backs. We
became nervous and fairly sick with it all. Father
could not bear to see us suffer, and one afternoon,
meeting John coming up the path to the house, he
stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what passed between them. Iris
and I saw only what happened. Father spoke a
few angry words to him and then they began to
fight. John walked out of the gate, never to
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How unfortunate!&rdquo; Doris murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Azalea said quietly, &ldquo;but that was not
the real tragedy. After their quarrel, Father
staggered up the walk toward the house. We ran
out, but before we could reach him, he fainted.
He had always been afflicted with heart trouble,
and the excitement was too much. In spite of
everything the doctors did for him, he passed
away in three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very sad!&rdquo; Kitty said sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor Uncle must have felt dreadfully
wicked when he learned of your father&rsquo;s death,&rdquo;
Doris commented.</p>
<p>Iris nodded soberly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine he did, for no one ever heard of him
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, Iris wiped the tears from her eyes
and Azalea turned her head to hide her face.
Doris felt a lump arising in her own throat as she
considered the sorrowful end to the romance. She
gazed thoughtfully toward the locked gates and a
hush fell over the group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">AN INTERLUDE</span></h2>
<p>Doris and Kitty thought that the Misses Gates
had finished their story, but presently, after a long
pause, Iris went on with difficulty:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the funeral we closed the front gates and
locked them. To this day they have never been
opened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could not bear to remain in Rumson after
all that had happened,&rdquo; Azalea said quietly. &ldquo;We
went to Europe&mdash;Iris to France and I to Germany.
There we plunged into study in the hope that it
would help us to forget. Finally, when the old
wound was partially healed, we once more turned
to each other and returned home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you both must be fluent linguists,&rdquo; Doris
broke in eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Iris agreed rather indifferently. &ldquo;I
speak French and Azalea has an excellent command
of German.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps you could help me! My singing
teacher says I must study French and German
this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure it would be a pleasure,&rdquo; Iris declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; Azalea added. &ldquo;We have so
little to occupy our time, and personally I shall be
glad of an opportunity to brush up on my German.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have troubled you enough for one day with
our unhappy history,&rdquo; Iris said lightly. &ldquo;Come, I
will show you the rest of the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris had hoped that the ladies would tell her
why they had invited her to Locked Gates, but apparently
they found it difficult to lead up to the
subject.</p>
<p>Three days slipped by almost before the girls
were aware of it. Once they had accustomed
themselves to the quiet life of the mansion, they
found it very enjoyable. They spent their mornings
romping in the garden with Wags and their
afternoons reading or sewing. Azalea and Iris left
them alone a great deal, no doubt thinking the
girls would have a better time by themselves.
However, Kitty and Doris observed that the Misses
Gates spent an hour of each day on the third floor,
and as the ladies always took their Bible with them,
they assumed that they were reading it there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Kitty commented to her chum.
&ldquo;You would think they could read it in the living
room as well as any other place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they don&rsquo;t like to do it when we are
around,&rdquo; Doris suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>The girls did not mean to pry, but, suspecting
that Cora and Henry Sully were aiding in a plot
against the Misses Gates, they were more watchful
than they otherwise might have been. On one
occasion, as they passed through a hall, they
chanced to hear the two engaged in conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see why they keep hangin&rsquo; on here unless
they&rsquo;re wise to something,&rdquo; Henry muttered to his
wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could they know?&rdquo; Cora had demanded
sullenly. &ldquo;If you keep a close tongue in your
head, nothing will get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one that has the wagging tongue,&rdquo;
Henry returned crossly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel better if Trent
would get back here. I&rsquo;m for gittin&rsquo; the thing over
with as quick as we can. No telling what may
queer the deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This snatch of conversation set Doris and Kitty
to thinking anew of the sinister plot which was
brewing. Yet, until they had learned more about
Ronald Trent, they did not wish to alarm the
Misses Gates. Since their arrival, Azalea and Iris
had been very kind to them and had seemed to enjoy
their company a great deal. Cora and Henry
Sully had been most unpleasant, especially when
there was no one about to observe their behavior,
but the girls, knowing what lay behind the sullen
actions, did not permit themselves to become annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They mean to make it so unpleasant for us that
we&rsquo;ll leave,&rdquo; Doris declared. &ldquo;You know, Cora
was hinting today that the mansion is haunted!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she said that since Mr. Gates died, they
have heard strange noises here at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris, do you believe the place is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Doris laughed reassuringly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re old enough to know there aren&rsquo;t any
ghosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Kitty quavered, &ldquo;but this house is old,
and we have been hearing strange noises at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true that each night the girls had been
disturbed by loud groans and the sound of gruff
voices. Doris had wondered if Cora and Henry
Sully were trying to frighten them, for certainly it
was not the wind that they heard.</p>
<p>It was lonesome and gloomy in the right wing of
the old mansion and the girls had come to dread the
nights. They would have been less nervous if
Wags had been permitted to stay with them, but
he had been consigned to the shelter of the porch.</p>
<p>Several times Doris and Kitty had been tempted
to tell the Misses Gates everything they had
learned, but knowing how partial the two ladies
were to Ronald Trent, they hesitated. It would
be better, they decided, to wait for the plotters to
make the first move.</p>
<p>Doris had wondered if Dave would visit her at
the mansion but she had not dared to hope that he
would come for at least a week. On the afternoon
of the third day she was, therefore, greatly
surprised when she heard the rhythmical hum of
an airplane motor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if it can be Dave?&rdquo; she exclaimed to
her chum.</p>
<p>Eagerly they watched as the plane swept closer.
Then Doris recognized the familiar craft and
scarcely could contain her excitement. The monoplane
circled low and Dave waved to them.
Finally he dropped a note to Doris telling her that
he intended to come to see her soon. After that
he turned back toward the airport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s just out for a trial flight today,&rdquo;
Doris declared.</p>
<p>When Kitty was not looking, she carefully
folded the note and placed it in her pocket for
future reference.</p>
<p>The sight of Dave, distant as it was, gave the
girls a slight touch of homesickness, and for want
of a better occupation they decided to write back
to their friends. They had the library to themselves,
for as usual Iris and Azalea had taken their
Bible with them to the third floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake certainly would enjoy this place,&rdquo; Doris
commented as she sat at the desk with pen poised.
&ldquo;He likes mysteries and things that smack of the
unusual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake has had an interesting past, didn&rsquo;t you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Uncle Ward rescued him from a bad gang.
I think Jake is still afraid of the old leader for he
never uses his real name and always seems half
afraid that some one he knows will find him. He
is absolutely devoted to us now and would do anything
in the world to help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell him to come down here and rid this
place of ghosts,&rdquo; Kitty joked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he could, all right. Jake wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate
to plow right into them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seriously, I wish he and that young man you
call Marshmallow would ride out here. Perhaps
they could help us to get a line on Ronald Trent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Doris agreed. &ldquo;But why bring
Marshmallow in on it? I guess you&rsquo;d like to see
him yourself, wouldn&rsquo;t you? I noticed you two
took to each other on sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind seeing Marshall if he happened
to be coming this way,&rdquo; Kitty admitted unembarrassed.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so jolly and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fat!&rdquo; Doris finished mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a little plump,&rdquo; Kitty admitted, &ldquo;but I
don&rsquo;t mind that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might write to Marshmallow and tell him
of our experiences here,&rdquo; Doris said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;It may be that we will need his help before we get
home again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>The girls fell to writing their letters and for some
time there was no sound other than the scratching
of their pens. Kitty wrote home while Doris sent
messages to her uncle, to a girl friend in Chilton,
to Dave, and to Marshmallow. She did not fail to
include a cheery word for Jake.</p>
<p>Having finished their writing, the girls took the
stamped letters and placed them in the mail box
where the postman would gather them up early the
next morning. They walked slowly back toward
the mansion, Wags trotting contentedly at their
heels.</p>
<p>Already it was dusk and the old mansion appeared
wrapped in gloom. During the day the
ancient house seemed less austere and mysterious,
but by night it took on a character which filled the
girls with uneasiness. Their imaginations tricked
them into believing that shadowy forms might lurk
behind the trees. They tried to shake off the
mood, but always with the darkness it came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is entirely different from Barry Manor,&rdquo;
said Doris. &ldquo;Fancy our sorority moving in here
for a week-end, that surely would liven things up
a bit, but would no doubt upset the lives of these
two ladies who live so secluded and almost a hermits&rsquo;
existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how the Misses Gates can stand to
live here all the time,&rdquo; Kitty said as they turned
toward the side door where Wags was to be tied
for the night. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be a nervous wreck. I wish
they would hurry up and tell you why they invited
you here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; Doris returned earnestly. &ldquo;I am sure
they haven&rsquo;t told us all of their story. To speak
of the past revives old memories and they keep
putting it off. Ronald Trent may come back any
day now and I want to learn just how matters stand
before he gets here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">AN IMPORTANT REQUEST</span></h2>
<p>Doris and Kitty spent an unpleasant night in
the right wing, for, as they had anticipated, the
weird noises began shortly after they had retired.
Once, hearing footsteps near their door, they
clutched each other in an agony of fear, but the
sound soon died away. They were on the verge
of falling asleep when a strange noise from a distant
part of the wing roused them into wakefulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is terrible!&rdquo; Kitty whispered. &ldquo;What
can be going on in this dreadful house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s only Cora or Henry astir,&rdquo; Doris
suggested, but the explanation did not satisfy her,
and Kitty refused to be comforted by it.</p>
<p>For long hours the girls lay awake, but once
asleep nothing disturbed them and they awoke in
the morning feeling refreshed in spite of the harrowing
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always something of a surprise each morning
when I wake up and find I&rsquo;m still alive,&rdquo; Kitty
laughed.</p>
<p>At breakfast Iris chanced to remark that an old
croquet set had been stored in the attic and Doris
and Kitty asked if they might use it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Iris assured them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it out
of the attic for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let us get it ourselves,&rdquo; Doris begged. &ldquo;I
just love to poke around in attics. It&rsquo;s on the
third floor above our wing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea and Iris exchanged quick, startled
glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Iris returned hastily. &ldquo;The attic is
in the left wing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought there was a floor above our bedroom,&rdquo;
Doris said, somewhat puzzled. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
been hearing such queer noises at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mice undoubtedly,&rdquo; Azalea explained and
arose from the table. &ldquo;If you want to see the
attic, come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went to the kitchen for a lantern and then
mounted the stairs to the third floor above the left
wing. Azalea unlocked the door and told them to
look about as much as they liked.</p>
<p>After Azalea had gone back down stairs, Doris
whispered to her chum:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you think the twins acted funny when
I asked about the third floor on our wing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did, Doris. They switched the subject,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>The attic was something of a disappointment,
for it was very clean and tidy. A number of boxes
lined the walls, but each was plainly labeled as to
its contents. Flashing the lantern about, the girls
saw that they contained blankets, woolens, old
clothing, and numerous other articles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing very exciting here,&rdquo; Kitty said. &ldquo;It
isn&rsquo;t any fun poking into boxes when they&rsquo;re all
labeled. I wish the Misses Gates weren&rsquo;t such
good housekeepers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris had found the croquet set and, with Kitty&rsquo;s
help, dragged it out into the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well take it down into the yard and
have a game,&rdquo; she suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Kitty agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hoped we
might stumble upon something interesting here, but
I guess there&rsquo;s no chance of it. You know, Doris,
I&rsquo;ve read about folks finding false bottom trunks
and things like that in their attics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it happens only in stories. Anyway, I
don&rsquo;t see any trunk here. If there&rsquo;s an attic above
the right wing, I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s more interesting than
this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Locking the attic door, the girls took the croquet
set down to the front lawn and set up the arches.
They played three games, Doris going down in
ignoble defeat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Croquet isn&rsquo;t my game,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
rather wield a tennis racquet than a mallet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon tiring of the sport they amused themselves
by throwing a rubber ball to Wags who would pick
it up in his mouth and return it to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Presently Iris and Azalea brought their sewing
and came out to sit in the swing. They watched
the girls for a time and then Iris called to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you would like to hear the rest of the
story we were telling you the other day?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; Doris declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;re only boring you,&rdquo; Azalea murmured.
&ldquo;We have no desire to inflict our troubles
upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Doris assured her.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re both very much interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Wags to his own devices, the girls sat
down in the swing beside the Misses Gates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go on with the story,&rdquo; Azalea murmured.</p>
<p>Iris did not begin at once but sat for some minutes
gazing away. At last, with a sigh, she forced
herself to take up the broken threads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For thirty-two years after John Trent left, we
heard no word from him,&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;Often
we wondered what might have become of him. At
first we thought perhaps he would write to one of
us&mdash;at least to tell us that he was sorry for everything
that had happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; Doris asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, to this day our only message has been
through his son. You may imagine our joy when
Ronald came to see us here at the mansion. He
resembles his mother more than his father, it seems,
so we did not recognize him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Kitty and Doris exchanged odd glances but Iris
did not notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ronald told us that his father was dead,&rdquo; she
continued in a low voice. &ldquo;His wife had died before
him, so Ronald was his heir. Before John
passed away, he begged Ronald to return to Rumson
and find the lovely Misses Gates. Those were
his very words! &lsquo;Do all in your power to make
them happy,&rsquo; he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Iris paused to wipe her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very dear of him to think of us at the
last,&rdquo; Azalea said softly, &ldquo;and very kind of his son
to come this far with the message. He remembered
us in a material way, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Iris went on bravely. &ldquo;It seems, that
after John left Rumson he accumulated a large
fortune. He willed three-quarters of the estate
to his son&mdash;which was as it should be&mdash;and the remaining
quarter to Azalea and myself, to be divided
equally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How considerate,&rdquo; Doris murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Iris agreed, &ldquo;and just at this time the
money will come in handy. You see, since Father
died the estate has dwindled. We have this property,
of course, but very little ready money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, we shall not be able to get our
inheritance for some time,&rdquo; Azalea explained.
&ldquo;There are certain legal complications which I do
not entirely understand. There seems to have
been some tangle about identifying poor John&rsquo;s
body at the time of his death and the estate is tied
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we shall get the money in the end,&rdquo;
Iris declared, &ldquo;but right now there are a number of
attorney&rsquo;s fees to be met. Ronald is entirely
without funds, so it was natural that he should
come to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave him money?&rdquo; Doris asked, although
she thought she knew the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we loaned him what we had, but our funds
are running low,&rdquo; Azalea told her. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as if
we were actually giving him the money, for in the
end every one will be rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ronald says he will pay us back when the estate
is settled,&rdquo; Iris added.</p>
<p>Doris and Kitty were so taken by surprise that
for a minute they could think of nothing to say.
The twins looked at each other in an embarrassed
way, and it was evident that they scarcely knew
how to go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless we can raise money to meet the necessary
attorney&rsquo;s fees, we will lose our inheritance,&rdquo;
Azalea said. &ldquo;We have nothing of value we can
sell except this mansion, and we are too old to
leave it after having lived here all these years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ronald has been so impatient at our reluctance
to do anything. Dear boy! One scarcely can
blame him, for his fortune, too, is at stake, and he
does not understand how low our funds are.&rdquo; Iris
hesitated as she finished lamely, &ldquo;And so, after
hours of debate, we decided that for the sake of
your own uncle, Doris, we would ask you for
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you understand we intend to will
everything to you at our death,&rdquo; Azalea added
hastily. &ldquo;It will be your own uncle&rsquo;s money, so it
will be entirely a family affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why you invited me here?&rdquo; Doris
stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Iris told her. &ldquo;You will help us, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris did not know what to reply; in fact, the
request left her a trifle dazed. She remembered
that Marshmallow had jokingly told her the Misses
Gates might ask for money, but she had not considered
the matter seriously. She actually had believed
that she was being invited to Locked Gates
for the purpose of being informed of an inheritance
of her own! What a blow to her hopes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know what to say,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;I must confess I have no idea how much
money of my own I actually have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course this has all been very sudden,&rdquo; Iris
said tactfully. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t expect you to decide
upon the instant, but after thinking it over, if you
decide you can spare the money, we shall be eternally
grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Azalea, taking up the subject.
Her sister sank back in the big, old-fashioned
rocker, like one in need of rest. &ldquo;We realize the
importance of not neglecting this business a day
longer. You will consider it soon, won&rsquo;t you,
Doris, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She, too, now leaned back in her chair with
something of a sigh of relief, making Doris aware
of the fact that her assistance was expected and
counted upon by her hostesses, who could from
now on assume that she would lift their burden
permanently.</p>
<p>Just then Cora, without any warning of her approach,
entered the room, carrying a number of
letters and several newspapers. She glanced at the
faces of the thoughtful group, as though she were
to be asked to remain, should her advice or assistance
be required. However, they were so absorbed
in what they had been discussing that they
did not notice Cora&rsquo;s being there, and, receiving no
word of encouragement to remain, even for a moment,
she bustled out of the door.</p>
<p>Wags bounded into the room, and came straight
up to Doris, attempting to jump into her lap and
to lick her hands and face caressingly.</p>
<p>Doris was glad of the interruption, for this gave
her an opportunity to get up from her chair and
shake the playful puppy off her lap.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>As soon as she gracefully could do so, Doris excused
herself and went to her room. She wished
to be alone that she might think over what the
twins had told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be that I have made a mistake about
Ronald Trent?&rdquo; she asked herself.</p>
<p>After all, she had heard him say only that he was
having trouble securing money from the two sisters.
But why, if his motives were honest, was he
in league with Cora and Henry Sully?</p>
<p>Doris admitted that the problem was too weighty
for her to solve at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">A VALUABLE FIND</span></h2>
<p>Doris found herself unable to reach any decision
concerning the loan which the Gates twins had
asked her to make, and the following morning she
was still thinking of the matter. Azalea and Iris
tactfully avoided mentioning the subject at the
breakfast table but she knew that it was foremost
in their minds.</p>
<p>Any day Ronald Trent might return and when
he came, he would expect the money. Doris disliked
the man and had no desire to help him, but
she felt sorry for the Misses Gates and wished that
she could aid them in obtaining their inheritance.
If only she knew that Ronald was acting honestly
and in good faith!</p>
<p>After the morning work had been done, Azalea
and Iris joined the girls on the lawn. Conversation
was rather labored and it was obvious to Doris
that the twins were under a strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry we told you our troubles,&rdquo; Iris said
after a time. &ldquo;It has ruined your visit, and you
undoubtedly think that our sole reason for inviting
you here was to ask for money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Doris assured her hastily. &ldquo;I have
enjoyed every minute here at Locked Gates. And
I truly want to help you. I was thinking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not continue for just at that moment she
caught the faint hum of an airplane engine.
Scrambling up from the grass, and shading her
eyes with her hand, she gazed eagerly skyward trying
to locate the sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I heard an airplane, but I can&rsquo;t see it.
The sun is so bright!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have been your imagination,&rdquo; Kitty
teased. &ldquo;Dave was here only the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an airplane!&rdquo; Doris cried excitedly. &ldquo;And
it&rsquo;s coming this way! Oh, I hope it&rsquo;s Dave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Misses Gates laid down their sewing and
watched the approaching plane with interest.
Doris and Kitty were highly elated when they distinguished
the red stars on the wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if he&rsquo;s going to drop another note?&rdquo;
Kitty murmured. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you the lucky girl to
have a flying Romeo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For once, Doris was not annoyed by her chum&rsquo;s
teasing. She was far too interested in watching
the plane to even listen closely to what Kitty was
saying.</p>
<p>They waved frantically as the plane approached.
Two young men were in the cockpit, Dave and another
pilot, and they both returned the greeting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>The plane circled over the mansion several times
and Dave indicated that he intended to drop a
message. They saw something white flutter from
his hand.</p>
<p>The weighted note struck a nearby rhododendron
bush, but, before the girls could reach it, Wags
scooted ahead of them, thinking that it was a variation
of his favorite game of &ldquo;fetch the ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wags!&rdquo; Doris cried.</p>
<p>The little brown dog turned to regard her with
surprise, and that gave the girls an opportunity to
catch up with him. But before they could lay restraining
hands upon him, he made another bolt for
the rhododendron bush.</p>
<p>As Wags snapped up the bit of paper in his
mouth, Doris and Kitty made a flying leap toward
him. In the mad scramble the girls lost their balance
and at the same moment clutched at the rhododendron
branches for support. To their horror,
their combined weight uprooted the bush and it
suddenly gave way from the soft earth, sending
them sprawling backwards.</p>
<p>Still clutching part of the bush they picked
themselves up and looked to see what had become
of Wags. He was standing not three yards away
regarding them with saucy little eyes which seemed
to say: &ldquo;If you want this old paper just try to get
it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>They tried to coax him nearer, but he would not
come, and as soon as they started toward him he
would dart away, only to pause whenever they
showed signs of giving up the chase. At last they
managed to drive him into a corner and there, with
considerable impatience, extracted the note from
between his teeth.</p>
<p>Returning to the Misses Gates they humbly
apologized for having broken the rhododendron
bush, but the ladies had thoroughly enjoyed the
wild chase and assured them that it was of no
consequence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had been planning to have that bush dug
out,&rdquo; Azalea laughed, &ldquo;but you girls saved us the
bother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it very romantic to have a love letter
delivered by airplane,&rdquo; Iris declared.</p>
<p>Doris blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t a love letter,&rdquo; she returned as she
ripped open the envelope. &ldquo;Dave isn&rsquo;t a bit silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps because she wished to prove her statement,
she read the note aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you and Kitty are free tomorrow and the
Misses Gates have no objection, I shall drop in
and take you for an airplane ride. Say about one
o&rsquo;clock, then we can have the entire afternoon.
Dave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Kitty cried in delight. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always
wanted to ride in a plane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So have I,&rdquo; Doris agreed enthusiastically. She
glanced hopefully at Azalea and Iris. &ldquo;May we
go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; Azalea declared. &ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t
you a little afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not with Dave,&rdquo; Doris returned proudly.
&ldquo;Every one says he is a reliable pilot and I know
he wouldn&rsquo;t offer to take us if he didn&rsquo;t know it
would be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had been so excited over the note that
they had failed to keep track of Wags. Turning,
they were amused to see him pawing energetically
near the uprooted rhododendron bush. Dirt was
flying in every direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that little rascal after now?&rdquo; Doris
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably a bone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She crossed the garden just as Wags picked up
something in his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Wags, bring it here!&rdquo; Doris commanded.</p>
<p>Wags hesitated, debating whether or not to obey,
and then came forward, dropping his offering at his
mistress&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world!&rdquo; Doris exclaimed.</p>
<p>She picked up the curious object. It was a tiny
box, water soaked and badly stained, and bore evidence
that it had been buried for some time. Yet,
for all its disfigurement, Doris saw that it was a
jewel box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kitty!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Come here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her chum already was flying toward her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look what the dog dug up!&rdquo; Doris exclaimed
in excitement. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a jewel box!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t stand there staring at it,&rdquo; Kitty
chided. &ldquo;Open it quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris lifted the lid and gave a little cry of
wonder. She scarcely could believe her own eyes.</p>
<p>There, nestled in a cushion of faded blue silk,
lay a beautiful ruby ring! Doris saw at a glance
that it was a genuine stone, and valuable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ring!&rdquo; Kitty gasped. &ldquo;Where did it come
from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under that rhododendron bush. It must have
been there for ages. See how old the case is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a perfectly gorgeous stone!&rdquo; Kitty said,
her eyes shining with admiration. &ldquo;Some one
must have lost it, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was <i>buried</i>,&rdquo; Doris reminded her. &ldquo;If
we hadn&rsquo;t uprooted that rhododendron bush, we&rsquo;d
never have discovered it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The excited comments of the girls had brought
the Misses Gates hurrying across the yard. They
too exclaimed in admiration as they saw the ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; Azalea asked tensely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took it away from Wags,&rdquo; Doris informed
her. &ldquo;It must have been buried under that bush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why was it put there?&rdquo; Iris murmured.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps it might have been a family
jewel,&rdquo; Doris suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Azalea protested. &ldquo;I never saw the
ring before in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any clue as to the identity of the
owner?&rdquo; Kitty questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be,&rdquo; Doris responded.</p>
<p>She lifted the ring from the tiny case and as she
did so, noticed for the first time a scrap of paper,
yellowed with age.</p>
<p>She read the name on it at a glance and a
startled expression came into her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It says &lsquo;John,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said in a strained voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Echoing the name, Azalea began to tremble.
Iris&rsquo;s face had gone chalk white.</p>
<p>Doris had turned the paper over and was reading
something upon the back. The twins scarcely
heard her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my beloved sweetheart,&rdquo; the note said, &ldquo;the
one I have chosen to be my wife. This ring is a
sign of my decision. Please wear it always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>did</i> choose,&rdquo; Doris declared tensely.</p>
<p>Azalea and Iris stood as motionless as statues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But which one?&rdquo; Azalea murmured.</p>
<p>Doris looked again at the message. It was so
old and yellow that it was difficult to make out the
writing, but unquestionably neither of the twins
had been mentioned by name. Her silence communicated
this to the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only we had known&mdash;&rdquo; Iris murmured
brokenly. &ldquo;What a difference it might have made.
That fatal night when Father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She choked and could not go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most beautiful ring I ever saw,&rdquo; Kitty
declared.</p>
<p>She restrained her enthusiasm, noting that it
seemed to pain the Misses Gates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it belongs to you,&rdquo; Doris said quietly,
&ldquo;even though your names aren&rsquo;t mentioned.&rdquo; She
extended the ring toward the two ladies.</p>
<p>Iris straightened proudly and Azalea turned
coldly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t belong to me,&rdquo; she said tartly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t touch it!&rdquo; Iris declared indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it must belong to one of you,&rdquo; Doris insisted.
&ldquo;What shall we do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea was already walking rapidly toward the
house. Iris, as pale as a ghost and looking as
though she were about to cry, likewise turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you do with it,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never touch it as long as I live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris and Kitty, left in possession of the ring,
stared at it rather blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of all things!&rdquo; Kitty exclaimed. &ldquo;Do
you think they&rsquo;ll change their minds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. This note and the ring have
opened up old wounds. Now they&rsquo;ll always be
tortured by thinking of what might have been.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>Being hampered by no sentimental attachments
themselves, the girls each tried on the ring. It
was too large for Kitty but it fit Doris&rsquo;s third
finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The setting is certainly old fashioned,&rdquo; Kitty
commented, &ldquo;but can&rsquo;t you imagine how gorgeous
it would look in a modern one! I think the Misses
Gates are foolish not to want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question is, what shall we do with it? We
can&rsquo;t very well wear it around in front of them.
They&rsquo;re so sensitive. And the ring doesn&rsquo;t belong
to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t belong to any one,&rdquo; Kitty declared.
&ldquo;The poor thing is an orphan! Until some one
turns in a claim, though, let&rsquo;s pretend it&rsquo;s ours.
This will probably be the nearest we&rsquo;ll ever come
to owning a ruby ring!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pirouetted around the room gaily, like a
ballet dancer doing a special number, flashing the
ring upon her finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful, young lady,&rdquo; admonished her chum.
&ldquo;Since it doesn&rsquo;t fit you, you may fling it away in
your ballet performance, never more to see the romantic
jewel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped her twirling and gazed at the sparkling
gem upon her finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a perfect stone,&rdquo; surmised Kitty, as
she glanced admiringly at the jewel which caught
the lights in its rich, deep tones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And more than that, think of the romance and
the tragedy hidden away in its very heart,&rdquo; and
Doris glanced thoughtfully in the direction of the
Locked Gates that appeared even more forbidding
and austere since this new connection with them
had been established.</p>
<p>A moment of silence followed, and Doris thought
suddenly of her friend Dave, and wondered what
he would think of the token and the story it symbolized.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">QUESTIONABLE CHARACTERS</span></h2>
<p>The Misses Gates did not appear at luncheon
but kept to their individual rooms. Azalea sent
word by Cora that she was ill with a headache and
preferred to be alone; Iris offered no excuse.
Kitty and Doris knew that they were still upset
over the finding of the ruby ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost wish Wags hadn&rsquo;t dug it up,&rdquo; Doris
remarked dolefully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s making the poor ladies
feel so unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls ate a rather forlorn meal in the big
dining room. Cora waited on them in a more slipshod
manner than usual and took no pains to conceal
her dislike. Shortly after luncheon, they saw
her leave the premises by the back gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll venture the Misses Gates don&rsquo;t know she&rsquo;s
leaving,&rdquo; Doris commented. &ldquo;Cora thinks they&rsquo;ll
not find out she&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mansion seemed very quiet and desolate to
the girls, and they found it difficult to settle down
to reading.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why not see something of the town ourselves?&rdquo;
Doris suggested by way of a question. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in
for a dull time here this afternoon if we don&rsquo;t bestir
ourselves. Anyway, I must send Dave a message
telling him we&rsquo;ll go with him tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me fine,&rdquo; Kitty agreed, putting aside her
book. &ldquo;But what shall we do about the ring?
We can&rsquo;t very well take it with us. We might be
robbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a loss to know what to do with the ruby,
Doris had carried it around in her pocket, but now
she removed the tiny case and studied it in perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish the Gates sisters would accept it,&rdquo; she
murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m scared to death we&rsquo;ll lose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t take it,&rdquo; Kitty returned, &ldquo;and you
know it will pain them to bring up the subject
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wear the ring, that&rsquo;s certain, for it
isn&rsquo;t ours. We&rsquo;ll have to hide it somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about our bedroom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Cora goes snooping around there.
She might find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; Doris exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hide it
under the mattress. No one would ever think of
looking there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; her chum approved. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do it now,
while the coast is clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried upstairs and, closing the bedroom
door, secreted the tiny jewel case beneath the mattress,
taking care to rearrange the covers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now we can forget about it,&rdquo; Kitty declared.</p>
<p>However, both girls knew that as long as the
ruby ring remained in their possession, they could
not forget its existence. It was certain to give
them many uneasy moments.</p>
<p>Satisfied that for the time being the jewel was
safe, they left the mansion by the back gate.</p>
<p>Locked Gates was located at the edge of Rumson
but it was only a short walk to the main part
of the little city. The girls stopped first at the
post office where they dispatched an air mail letter
to Dave.</p>
<p>Then, as time rested heavily upon them, they
dropped in at a corner drug store for an ice cream
soda. Doris bought a few things she needed, and
they continued down the street with no particular
destination in view.</p>
<p>Not being acquainted with the town, they unwittingly
turned down a street which led them toward
the poorer section. They had gone a considerable
distance before they realized their error.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s turn back,&rdquo; Doris suggested. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
like the appearance of this street. There are so
many pool halls and gambling places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abruptly they retraced their steps but, before
they had gone far, Doris caught her chum by the
sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she commanded. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that Henry
Sully just ahead of us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is!&rdquo; Kitty agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll meet him face to
face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was walking toward the girls, but his
head was lowered and he had not seen them.
While he was still at least a hundred yards away,
he turned into an old tumbledown building which
opened off the street.</p>
<p>As Kitty and Doris passed the place a few minutes
later, they surveyed it rather curiously and
were not surprised to see that it was probably a
gambling house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the way he spends his time!&rdquo; Doris
commented. &ldquo;I guess he knew the Misses Gates
were in their rooms and that he would have a good
chance to slip away with no questions asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice the way he walked, Dory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. His head was down&mdash;sort of flopping
all around. And he walked with such a precise
step as though he were trying not to stagger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s had about one drink too many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably six would be more like it. Do you
suppose the Misses Gates know he drinks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure they don&rsquo;t. You know how strict
they are about such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s time they find out about their help,
then. I don&rsquo;t see how they can be so blind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>They continued down the street and presently
had forgotten about Henry Sully. The town was
soon explored and they were thinking of returning
to the mansion when Kitty suggested that they attend
a moving picture show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Doris agreed, &ldquo;if we can find anything
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had noticed a number of theaters near the
post office and turned that way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming to one now,&rdquo; Kitty observed a
few minutes later. &ldquo;Can you make out the sign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we don&rsquo;t want to go there,&rdquo; Doris said
hastily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of those cheap places that cater
to folks with perverted tastes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were about to pass on without a glance at
the advertisements when they noticed a familiar
figure. Of one accord they paused and pretended
to be looking at the window display of a candy
shop adjoining the theater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Cora Sully!&rdquo; Kitty whispered to her chum.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s buying a ticket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without glancing in their direction, the woman
entered the moving picture house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they a pair!&rdquo; Doris exclaimed in disgust.
&ldquo;Henry half drunk in a gambling place and Cora
here at this cheap movie! I don&rsquo;t see how Azalea
and Iris can tolerate them&mdash;they are so refined
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either they don&rsquo;t know about it, or they must
have some very special reason for keeping them.
Didn&rsquo;t they say Cora was the daughter of their
former dressmaker?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, perhaps they keep the couple out of sheer
sentiment. I&rsquo;m sure if I were in their place I&rsquo;d
send Cora and Henry away in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Farther on down the street the girls found a picture
house which satisfied them and they purchased
tickets. The show lasted for two hours and when
they left the theater, it was nearly supper time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be getting back to the mansion,&rdquo; Doris
declared. &ldquo;Before we go, though, I have a notion
I ought to put in a telephone call to the bank at
Chilton and find out how much money I have there.
I&rsquo;d ask Uncle Ward but he&rsquo;s still out of town campaigning
for that Fresh Air Fund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve decided to loan the Misses Gates
the money they want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I haven&rsquo;t decided anything. I don&rsquo;t know
what to do! I thought if I found out exactly how
much money I have, it might be easier to decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take very long to put the call through,&rdquo;
Kitty urged. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris consulted her wrist watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bank is closed by this time, but I am sure
there will be some one there who can tell me what
I want to know. We&rsquo;ll try it, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned in at the next drug store and, after
a brief wait, Doris was connected with her party.
After a few minutes she received the information
she sought and came back to Kitty, who was waiting
outside the booth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find out?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>Doris nodded. Her eyes were shining.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Kit, I have a lot of money. From what
Uncle Ward told me the other day I thought I was
almost poverty stricken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly six thousand dollars. Five thousand
nine hundred and forty-three, to be exact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re rich, Dory!&rdquo; Kitty exclaimed in
awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly that, but I&rsquo;ll have enough to last me
for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls, blissfully ignorant of how much it
cost to live, considered Doris&rsquo;s little hoard a miniature
fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I have so much, it seems a shame not to
make a small loan to Iris and Azalea,&rdquo; Doris said
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They promised you&rsquo;d get it all back,&rdquo; Kitty
encouraged. &ldquo;In the end you&rsquo;ll come into the
Trent inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one drawback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cousin Ronald is to handle the money.&rdquo; Doris
sighed as one who was burdened with great business
responsibilities. &ldquo;Oh, dear, I wish I liked
him better. If I could entirely trust him, I&rsquo;d offer
the money in a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">A PLEASANT ADVENTURE</span></h2>
<p>The next morning when Doris and Kitty came
downstairs for breakfast, they were relieved to see
that the Misses Gates were there ahead of them.
However, they noticed at once that for the first
time since their arrival at the mansion, the two
ladies were dressed differently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means they&rsquo;ve been quarrelling,&rdquo; Doris
told herself.</p>
<p>Iris and Azalea spoke pleasantly to the girls but
their faces were wan and strained. They avoided
speaking to each other and scarcely glanced at one
another. Kitty and Doris, distressed at the situation,
were very glad that they had accepted Dave&rsquo;s
invitation to go for a ride in his plane. It would
be a relief to get away from the mansion. The
place was beginning to get on their nerves.</p>
<p>Azalea and Iris ate very little, making the girls
feel somewhat guilty concerning their own hearty
appetites. All mention of the ruby ring was carefully
avoided, but the subject was uppermost in
the minds of the four. Conversation languished
and the Misses Gates obviously were relieved when
breakfast was finished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>During the night Doris had tried to make up her
mind what was the best thing to do in regard to the
loan which the Misses Gates had requested, but
she had been unable to reach a decision. Now, as
she saw how very unhappy the two ladies were and
how strained was the relationship between them,
she wished that she might do something to help the
situation before she and Kitty left on their outing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lend them the money,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Perhaps
the news will cheer them a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly, as they were leaving the dining
room, she turned to Azalea and Iris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday when Kitty and I were in Rumson,
I telephoned my bank,&rdquo; she told them, &ldquo;and I
found that I have more money in my account than
I had anticipated. So I&rsquo;ve been thinking it over
and have decided to let you have some of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Azalea exclaimed, her face lighting up.
&ldquo;How very kind of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you can spare the money?&rdquo; Iris
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bookkeeper said that I had six thousand
dollars,&rdquo; Doris admitted, &ldquo;so I can let you have
only five hundred. If that will be of any help&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it will,&rdquo; Azalea declared. &ldquo;I cannot
tell you how grateful we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Ronald will appreciate it, too,&rdquo; Iris added.
&ldquo;It means so much to us just at this time. Of
course, in the end you will get it all back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to do what I can to help,&rdquo; Doris told
them.</p>
<p>Already she was pleased to see that the tension
between Iris and Azalea was somewhat relaxed.
She hoped that before the day was over they would
have forgotten their foolish quarrel.</p>
<p>As Dave had stated that he would call for the
girls about one o&rsquo;clock, they began to watch for
him soon after luncheon. As the airport was some
distance from the mansion, they expected him to
come for them in a car, and accordingly kept close
watch of the road.</p>
<p>Presently an automobile drove up, and Doris
and Kitty, thinking it must be Dave, snatched up
their wraps and started for the gate. Halfway
down the path they saw they had made a mistake.
Ronald Trent was getting out of his roadster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, girlies,&rdquo; he greeted with a sickening smile
as he opened the gate. &ldquo;Coming to meet me, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we weren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Doris returned. &ldquo;We are
waiting for a friend of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going for an airplane ride,&rdquo; Kitty added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;High fliers, eh?&rdquo; Ronald smirked, and then
laughed loudly at his own inane joke.</p>
<p>Doris and Kitty did not even smile. They
wished that he would go on into the house and
leave them alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that flying sweetheart of yours?&rdquo; he
teased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t a sweetheart and you don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo;
Doris replied somewhat coldly. &ldquo;Come on, Kitty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started to walk to the gate but the man
called them back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute. Aren&rsquo;t you forgetting something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls paused and looked at him in surprise.
Ronald came over to Doris and leaned unpleasantly
close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you forgotten to give Cousin Ronald a
goodbye kiss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indignantly, Doris recoiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in the habit of kissing strangers!&rdquo; she
snapped. &ldquo;That remark was entirely uncalled
for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, don&rsquo;t be bashful,&rdquo; Ronald cajoled.</p>
<p>He edged nearer and caught her by the hand.
Doris jerked away and faced him with blazing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare touch me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Ronald would have pressed his unwelcome
attentions, but just at that instant an
automobile drove up to the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, we&rsquo;ll save it until the next time,&rdquo; he
said with a shrug.</p>
<p>Chuckling gleefully to himself, he went on up the
path toward the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how I hate that man!&rdquo; Doris muttered in
an undertone to her chum. &ldquo;I wanted to slap his
face!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They said no more, for turning toward the gate
they saw that Dave had arrived. Eagerly he
sprang from the taxicab and came to meet them.
Noticing Doris&rsquo;s flushed and angry face he asked
what was the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was that horrid cousin of mine,&rdquo; she told
him. &ldquo;He tried to get fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did?&rdquo; Dave demanded sharply. &ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ll
just go after him and tell him a thing or two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris placed a restraining hand on his sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you mustn&rsquo;t do that. Iris and Azalea
would never forgive us for creating a scene. I
don&rsquo;t doubt but that it&rsquo;s just his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;d better change it if he doesn&rsquo;t want to
get into trouble with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a scowl directed at the back of the retreating
Cousin Ronald, Dave opened the gate for the
girls and helped them into the taxi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t entirely trust
me as a pilot,&rdquo; he declared as they were speeding
rapidly toward the airfield, &ldquo;so I brought along an
expert. There isn&rsquo;t a better pilot to be had than
Don Everts. He&rsquo;s waiting for us at the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know we&rsquo;d trust you,&rdquo; Doris protested
quickly.</p>
<p>Dave grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, I thought it would give me a
better chance to talk with you girls.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>A few minutes later the cab turned in at the flying
field and came to a standstill near a row of
hangars. Dave helped the girls to alight and paid
the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; he directed, leading them toward a
monoplane at the far end of the runway.</p>
<p>Quickly he introduced Don Everts, the pilot, a
lean chap in helmet and dungarees. The girls
found him very quiet and self-contained, but liked
him at once.</p>
<p>They took their places in the cockpit and Dave
smiled at them reassuringly. The pilot carefully
examined the controls and then nodded to the
mechanic who stood waiting to swing the propeller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Switch off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Switch off!&rdquo; the pilot confirmed tersely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contact?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contact!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mechanic gave the propeller a mighty swing
and the engine began to roar. To Doris and Kitty
it was all very thrilling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set?&rdquo; Dave questioned after the engine had
warmed up.</p>
<p>Kitty and Doris nodded grimly.</p>
<p>The monoplane had headed into the wind, and
as Don Everts opened the throttle, it moved rapidly
across the field. The girls held their breath, but
almost before they were aware of it, the plane had
taken to the air and leveled off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>It no longer seemed to Kitty and Doris that they
were traveling swiftly, for the plane appeared to be
almost stationary in the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not going very fast, are we?&rdquo; Doris asked
Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninety-eight miles per!&rdquo; he shouted back.</p>
<p>Glancing down, the girls saw the earth pass
slowly in review before them. They made out a
few buildings but it was difficult to believe that the
miniature structures comprised the town of Rumson.</p>
<p>The day was an ideal one for flying, with very
few clouds visible. That the girls might enjoy the
novelty of their ride to the utmost, the pilot presently
zoomed up above a small bank of mist and
permitted them to look down upon the fleece-like
floor.</p>
<p>For Doris and Kitty, who were having the thrill
of their lives, the time passed all too swiftly.
When Dave told them that they had been in the
air nearly two hours they were amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had so much fun in ages,&rdquo; Doris declared
enthusiastically, after they had landed safely
at the air field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you up again,&rdquo; Dave promised, &ldquo;and
now that I know you won&rsquo;t be afraid, I&rsquo;ll pilot you
myself some time. I should have my license in a
little while.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>Leaving the monoplane to the care of an attendant,
the two young men escorted the girls to a
taxicab and took seats beside them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, I was thinking perhaps we could get
up a picnic one of these days,&rdquo; Dave suggested as
they drove toward the mansion. &ldquo;Marshmallow
has been hinting that he wants to be included.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think a picnic would be lots of fun,&rdquo; Doris
declared, &ldquo;and by all means let&rsquo;s have Marshmallow.
He always brings the best things to
eat! Of course that isn&rsquo;t my reason for wanting
him,&rdquo; she added hastily, as the others began to
laugh.</p>
<p>During the flight Dave had chanced to remark
that Don Everts had formerly piloted an air mail
plane and had a flying acquaintance with nearly
every town and city in the east. Doris had been
longing to ask him if he had ever passed over
Cloudy Cove and now she broached the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousin comes from there,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloudy Cove?&rdquo; the pilot repeated thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Sure, I remember the place. It&rsquo;s in Massachusetts.
City of about thirty or forty thousand, I&rsquo;d
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The taxicab drew up at the rear gate of the old
mansion, and the four alighted. Doris noticed
that Ronald Trent&rsquo;s red roadster was still parked
nearby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in?&rdquo; she asked the two young
men. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t late yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>They accepted with alacrity and the girls led
the way to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Cousin Ronald doesn&rsquo;t try any more of
his foolishness,&rdquo; Doris said in an undertone to
Kitty.</p>
<p>Entering the house they found the Gates twins
and Ronald in close conference. Doris thought
Azalea and Iris looked somewhat relieved as the
group came into the living room and wondered
what her cousin had been saying to disturb them.</p>
<p>The twins were delighted that the girls had
brought their friends into the house, and at once
made them feel at ease, but Ronald frowned as
though he considered it an intrusion. He spoke
agreeably enough to Dave when introduced, but it
was apparent to the girls that they took an instant
dislike to each other.</p>
<p>While the Misses Gates chatted pleasantly with
Doris and her friends, Ronald fidgeted in his chair
and kept glancing at his watch. After a few minutes
he abruptly arose and, with only a few words
spoken quietly to Azalea and Iris, departed.</p>
<p>After that, Doris sang a number of songs which
met with enthusiastic approval. Azalea rang for
the tea things and, as the hour grew late, Dave and
his friend regretfully took their departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the picnic,&rdquo; the girls were reminded
by Dave as he said goodbye. &ldquo;We can
decide upon the date and the place later on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We will watch for your message,&rdquo; assured
Kitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A summer without a picnic wouldn&rsquo;t be a summer
at all,&rdquo; sang Doris, as the two girls waved
goodbye and opened the back gate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">A DOG&rsquo;S DISCOVERY</span></h2>
<p>Doris and Kitty did not spend a comfortable
night. Since the ruby ring had been given into
their keeping, they found themselves unable to
sleep as soundly as before and the slightest noise
caused them uneasiness.</p>
<p>Retiring early as was their custom since coming
to Locked Gates, they dropped off almost at once,
but some time after midnight they were suddenly
awakened by a wild cry. To the frightened girls
it sounded strangely like some one in distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This house gets more creepy all the time,&rdquo;
Kitty whispered shakily. &ldquo;That couldn&rsquo;t have
been the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Doris agreed, &ldquo;it sounded like a human
voice to me. I wish we weren&rsquo;t alone in this
wing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that they lay awake for several hours, but
the cry was not repeated. Finally they fell asleep
again, and when they opened their eyes the morning
sun was shining brightly in at the windows.</p>
<p>Somewhat ashamed of their fears, now that it
was broad daylight, the girls did not mention the
subject at the breakfast table. Azalea and Iris
appeared more cheerful than on the previous day
and Doris was glad to see that they were both
wearing blue dresses, a sign that they had partially
forgotten their disagreement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Before breakfast had been finished, Ronald
Trent put in his appearance. The girls were surprised
at such an early call, but apparently Iris
and Azalea knew what brought him, for they exchanged
rather embarrassed glances. For once
the man did not flatter and palaver with the ladies
but turned his attention to Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, cousin,&rdquo; he began in his blustering way,
&ldquo;I hear you&rsquo;ve promised to come across with five
hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised the Misses Gates that amount,&rdquo; she
returned, placing stress upon the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it all amounts to the same thing,&rdquo; Ronald
said easily. &ldquo;Naturally, they&rsquo;ll turn the money
over to me, so I can attend to the&mdash;the attorney&rsquo;s
fees. It will save a lot of trouble if you will have
the bank draft made out in my name. I&rsquo;ll tell you
just how to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have secured drafts before,&rdquo; Doris informed
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smart little business woman, eh? How soon
will you be able to get to the bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I could go today,&rdquo; Doris said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! Don&rsquo;t forget to have the draft made
out in my name.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>While they had been talking, Henry Sully had
entered the dining room to ask the Misses Gates a
question concerning the gardening work to be done
that day, and now as Ronald turned around he
gave the man a sly wink. Doris, who was by
chance looking directly into the buffet mirror, saw
the wink and immediately her suspicions were
aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On second thought,&rdquo; she remarked, eying Ronald
closely, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ll be able to get to
the bank today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man wheeled and regarded her sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I have some practising to do and I must
study my French,&rdquo; Doris returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you in my car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I really won&rsquo;t be able to make it
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a ring of finality to her voice, but
Ronald did not give up. Instead, he changed his
tactics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A delay may mean the loss of the entire inheritance,
Doris,&rdquo; he began in a soft, wheedling
voice. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t realize how lucky you are to
get into the good graces of the Misses Gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been more than kind,&rdquo; Doris murmured,
feeling very uncomfortable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, cousin, you stick with me in this deal
and you&rsquo;ll come out on top of the heap. Why, before
you get through, you&rsquo;ll be rich. You&rsquo;ll sing
in Grand Opera!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to get to the bank some time this week,&rdquo;
she told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not go today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Ronald, I don&rsquo;t think you should urge
her,&rdquo; Iris interposed in her gentle voice. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
quite see the need for such haste. Surely the
lawyers will wait a few days for their money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot you all know about business!&rdquo; the man
blurted out, and then caught himself and spoke
more quietly. &ldquo;I suppose we shall have to await
the whim of this kid, but if we lose the entire
fortune, don&rsquo;t blame me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he strode out of the house, banging
the door behind him. Henry, who had stood
listening to the entire conversation, followed him
without waiting for his orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ronald is so impetuous,&rdquo; Iris said apologetically
to the girls. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t take him seriously.
He really doesn&rsquo;t mean anything the way it
sounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris and Kitty had their own idea as to that,
but they permitted the matter to pass without stating
their views. Breakfast finished, the Misses
Gates went out into the garden and Kitty went to
her room, taking Wags with her. Doris was left
to practise her music, but for some time she sat
idle at the piano.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I should have gone to the bank this
morning?&rdquo; she thought uncomfortably. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to do anything to jeopardize the fortune,
and yet, try as I may, I simply can&rsquo;t trust that
man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation which she had overheard between
Ronald and Henry Sully on the first night of
her arrival came back to her. She remembered
that Ronald had called the other man &ldquo;Hank&rdquo; and
that they had appeared to be on unusually friendly
terms. Perhaps in her desire to aid the Misses
Gates she was overlooking a number of important
facts. Was it not an unwise step to lend her
money without first consulting her uncle?</p>
<p>At length she began to practise, but she could
not concentrate, and after three-quarters of an
hour decided to give it up.</p>
<p>She started up the stairs to find Kitty, but before
she had gone very far down the hall leading
to the right wing, she met her chum and Wags coming
toward her. She saw at a glance that the girl
was greatly excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; she asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Doris,&rdquo; Kitty whispered tensely. &ldquo;I was
just on my way to find you! I think I&rsquo;ve discovered
the source of those strange sounds that
have been disturbing us at night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wags is really responsible, because he led the
way. He ran off and I had to go after him.
Quite by accident I stumbled upon this room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about, Kitty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, I&rsquo;ll show you. Follow me and don&rsquo;t
make any noise.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">THE FLOOR ABOVE</span></h2>
<p>Wondering what it was her chum had discovered,
Doris followed her down the hall. Kitty
paused at the door of their own bedroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better leave Wags here until we come
back,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;He might take it into his
head to bark at the wrong moment and give us
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving the dog in the bedroom, they listened
to make certain that the coast was clear and then
stole softly down the long dark hallway until they
came to a flight of stairs leading to the attic floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is as far as I came when I chased Wags,&rdquo;
Kitty whispered, &ldquo;but I distinctly could hear the
strangest sounds coming from that room at the top
of the stairs. I was afraid to go on alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this must be part of the quarters occupied
by the Sullys,&rdquo; Doris told her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen
them go up the back stairs any number of times.
Do you think we should go up when they aren&rsquo;t
here? Cora is working in the kitchen and Henry
is out in the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But just listen,&rdquo; Kitty commanded. &ldquo;Some
one is up there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>The girls listened intently and to their startled
ears there came a low moan, not unlike the sound
they had heard during the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose Henry <i>could</i> be up there?&rdquo;
Kitty whispered. &ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;s drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I saw him in the yard just before I came up
to find you. It can&rsquo;t be either Cora or Henry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who can it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noiselessly, they crept up the stairs which
creaked alarmingly underfoot. At the top of the
landing they hesitated, a little afraid to open the
door leading into the Sully suite. At last, summoning
all of her courage, Doris turned the knob
and pushed the door back a tiny way.</p>
<p>Peeping through the crack, the girls saw only an
empty and very untidy sitting room. Becoming
bolder, Doris opened the door wider and they
stepped inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be anything wrong
here,&rdquo; she murmured in perplexity.</p>
<p>Just at that moment there came another, moan,
louder than before. Kitty clutched her chum
nervously by the arm and would have retreated
from the room had not Doris held her back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming from that bedroom,&rdquo; she whispered,
indicating a closed door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back,&rdquo; Kitty begged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I intend to find out what that noise is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But some one may come up the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They listened, but heard nothing behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it could be an animal?&rdquo; questioned
Kitty, wide-eyed with fear, as another moan
came from the room beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; warned Doris.</p>
<p>They took a step forward.</p>
<p>Another groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting frightened,&rdquo; whispered Kitty in a
voice full of distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Kitty, I think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it be, Doris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look down the stairs again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty obeyed, stepping noiselessly backward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems all right down there,&rdquo; Kitty said, motioning
with her hand in the direction of the floor
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Doris.</p>
<p>Doris tiptoed across the sitting room and after
a brief hesitation stooped down and peeped through
the keyhole. Through the tiny aperture she looked
into a barren and dismal bedroom. The curtains
were drawn and at first she could distinguish little.</p>
<p>The weird sounds had begun again, but Doris
could not decide where they came from. Kitty
was tugging at her hand, trying to induce her to
retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; Doris whispered. &ldquo;I can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>With a start she broke off as she beheld a strange
sight. She made out a figure stretched out on the
sagging bed and her first thought was that it must
be Cora and that she was in severe pain. Yet she
knew this could not be, for the housekeeper was in
the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what is it?&rdquo; Kitty demanded as she heard
another loud moan.</p>
<p>This time Doris knew that the sound had fallen
from the lips of the woman lying on the bed. But
was it a woman? As the figure turned slightly on
the bed, Doris saw that she had been mistaken. It
was a girl not more than eighteen or twenty years
of age. Her face was childish, almost baby-like,
but tortured with pain and suffering.</p>
<p>Then Doris&rsquo;s eyes traveled farther and she beheld
the twisted body and misshapen limbs. The
child was a cripple!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can she be?&rdquo; Doris asked herself. &ldquo;And
why is she hidden here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the answer flashed through her mind.
Undoubtedly this child was the daughter of Henry
and Cora Sully whom the world did not know existed.
But why did they keep her secreted? Was
it because they were ashamed of her or merely indifferent?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo; Kitty whispered
nervously. &ldquo;Let me see!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Doris moved aside to permit her chum to peep
through the keyhole. One glance was sufficient for
Kitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how dreadful!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Who can
she be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought she might be a daughter of the Sullys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a marked facial resemblance,&rdquo; Kitty
agreed. &ldquo;Do you suppose the Misses Gates know
she is here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they must. They come up here nearly
every day ostensibly to read their Bibles. They
probably come to see this crippled child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor thing,&rdquo; Kitty murmured, &ldquo;I feel so sorry
for her. Dare we go in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we shouldn&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s likely dying
of lonesomeness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris took hold of the door-knob but she did not
turn it, for just at that moment the girls heard the
sound of footsteps on the floor below. The door
at the bottom of the stairs closed. The girls exchanged
frightened glances. Some one was coming
and they were trapped! How could they explain
their presence in the suite?</p>
<p>Doris cast a frantic glance over the sitting room
and noticed a closet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, we must hide!&rdquo; she whispered to Kitty.
They tiptoed across the room and entered the
closet, softly closing the door behind them. They
were not an instant too soon, for whoever was coming
had reached the top of the stairway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>Daringly Doris peeped out through a crack to see
who it was. To her surprise she beheld Azalea
Gates. Bible in hand, the old lady entered the
living room, crossed directly to the bedroom and
without a glance in the direction of the closet went
in and closed the door behind her.</p>
<p>The girls waited a few minutes to make certain
that she would not return. When they heard a
droning voice begin one of the Psalms, they knew
they were safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is our chance,&rdquo; Doris whispered.</p>
<p>They slipped quietly out of the closet, and stole
to the door. The stairs creaked alarmingly as
they went down and they were afraid they would
be heard. To their relief they reached the second
floor in safety. Somewhat guiltily they rushed
down the hall and entered their own bedroom.</p>
<p>There they snatched up Wags who had grown
impatient waiting for them, and fled from the
house. It was a relief to reach the warm sunshine,
for the sight they had just witnessed had thrown
a pall over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it awful, Dory, to see a helpless cripple
like that? I wonder if a doctor ever comes here,&rdquo;
mused Kitty sadly, &ldquo;to give the poor thing relief.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We might have gone up before if the twins had
only told us we could and tried to entertain the
child,&rdquo; suggested Doris generously. &ldquo;Perhaps my
singing might have eased her pain for a while, at
least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a dear, Dory, always wanting to cheer
up everybody with your lovely voice. But why,&rdquo;
Kitty continued thoughtfully, &ldquo;do you suppose this
is kept a secret? We cannot help if the Misses
Gates do not wish us to intrude on their private affairs.
They may think we are dreadfully bold and
presumptuous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We probably shouldn&rsquo;t have gone up there,&rdquo;
Doris declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did we know who was there?&rdquo; Kitty
returned. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know but that some one
was in trouble. When we started out, we thought
we were after a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as though I had seen one now,&rdquo; Doris
said with a nervous laugh. &ldquo;I do hope we don&rsquo;t
discover any more weird things about this place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My! but this bright sunlight feels good and
warms one up after that musty, drab third floor,
with its queer noises and moanings coming from the
most unexpected places. What would Mrs. Marshall
say to this clutter of old furniture and bedding?
I&rsquo;ll bet she wouldn&rsquo;t care to keep house for
the Misses Gates,&rdquo; and Doris laughed as she adjusted
her beret over her reddish-brown curls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m only a visitor here,&rdquo; said Kitty,
&ldquo;and not a life inmate.&rdquo; She chuckled at the
thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>Down the steps came the two girls. They
glanced back to see who might be listening to this
conversation between them. They did not wish to
be overheard by any one within the rambling old
structure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">UNDER THE WINDOW</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;This mansion surely is queer, that&rsquo;s all I can
say,&rdquo; Kitty declared feelingly as she and Doris,
followed by Wags, walked slowly down toward the
front entrance. &ldquo;One minute I want to rush right
away and then again I like to be here just to see
what will turn up next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel the same way,&rdquo; Doris agreed, gazing
thoughtfully down at her chum, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t feel
like paying five hundred dollars to see the show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a lot of money, but think what you will
get eventually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a tempting proposition and I have
absolute confidence in the Misses Gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what is troubling you, Dory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it seems to me Ronald Trent isn&rsquo;t honest
and I can&rsquo;t understand why he is on such friendly
terms with Henry Sully. Ugh! The more I see
of the whole outfit the less I like them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here! But you&rsquo;ve practically given Ronald
the money, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t it yet, Kit, and the more I think
about it, the more I&rsquo;m inclined to change my
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it may mean losing your inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve a plan, Kit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll not get a bank draft at all, as Ronald
suggested I do. Instead, I&rsquo;ll write a letter to Jake
and ask him to go to the Chilton bank and get the
cash for me. I&rsquo;ll have him bring it here to the
mansion himself! Ronald can&rsquo;t very well protest
at that, and in the meantime perhaps we can learn
more about him. How does that strike you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brilliant!&rdquo; Kitty approved in admiration, &ldquo;but
why have Jake come with the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thought he&rsquo;d like it up here, as he used to
work at Rumson. And for another thing, he might
be able to help us. You never can tell what may
turn up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake is a regular whiz at detecting schemes,
Kit, and if anything is wrong here, he&rsquo;s apt to find
it out in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always did have brains,&rdquo; Kitty said admiringly.
&ldquo;How do you think of things like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it took me several days,&rdquo; Doris admitted
with a laugh.</p>
<p>The morning passed rather slowly for the girls.
They knew that Azalea was with the crippled child
and Iris had gone to her room. They played several
games of croquet, but it was dull sport when
they were accustomed to tennis and golf. Wags
seemed less entertaining than usual and presently
wandered off toward the rear of the estate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where did that dog go?&rdquo; Kitty asked when
they had finished their game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back of the house somewhere. I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s
into some mischief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better go after him,&rdquo; Kitty suggested.</p>
<p>Dropping their croquet mallets, they leisurely
made their way toward the rear of the mansion.
Passing beneath the kitchen window they sniffed
the appetizing odor of the cooking dinner and
wished that it were time to eat. Though they disliked
Cora Sully most heartily, they agreed that
she was an excellent cook.</p>
<p>The girls had no intention of lingering by the
kitchen window, but as they passed they were
startled to hear a voice which they recognized as
that of Henry. They would have paid no heed,
but one sentence forced itself upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>If only we could git rid of her!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Involuntarily, Doris and Kitty halted and listened.
They were not given to eavesdropping or
to interfering in affairs which did not concern them,
but the implied threat of violence assured them a
sinister plot was in the brewing and they did not
know but that they were destined to be the victims.
What they heard next set them at rest on
this score.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If Etta was out of the way, then we could
travel on some of that money Trent promised us
from the oil land,&rdquo; Henry muttered.</p>
<p>Kitty and Doris exchanged puzzled glances.
Who was Etta? The question was answered for
them as Cora began to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cripple!&rdquo; she complained. &ldquo;What can you
do tied to such a child? She&rsquo;s nothing but a
burden, anyway. It&rsquo;s better if she&rsquo;s put out of the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to be careful,&rdquo; Henry warned in a
low voice. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t do to git the old ladies suspicious.
And we daren&rsquo;t do anything rash till we
git our hands on that paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris and Kitty, now convinced that the two in
the kitchen were disclosing important information,
crept nearer the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see where they keep it hid,&rdquo; Cora returned
sullenly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked the house over from
top to bottom but I can&rsquo;t find the paper anywhere.
I know it&rsquo;s here somewhere, probably in one of
their desks, but they keep &rsquo;em locked and I haven&rsquo;t
been able to get the keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls heard no more, for just then Henry,
evidently fearing that some one might overhear the
conversation, crossed over to the window and
slammed it shut. Kitty and Doris pressed their
bodies up close to the house, but they were in no
danger of being discovered, for the man did not
glance out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Frightened at what they had learned, the girls
moved swiftly away from the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What next?&rdquo; Kitty murmured when they were
some distance away. &ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;re nothing but
criminals! They mean to do away with that poor
little crippled girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if we can prevent it!&rdquo; Doris said grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep close watch on them. There&rsquo;s one
thing certain. They won&rsquo;t attempt to harm Etta
until they get that paper they spoke of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think it can be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some kind of stock or deed, I imagine. We&rsquo;ll
speak to the Misses Gates about it at the first opportunity.
And in the meantime, we mustn&rsquo;t let
on that we suspect anything!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">A PICNIC</span></h2>
<p>Doris did not have an opportunity that day to
speak to the Misses Gates concerning the mysterious
paper which Cora and Henry Sully had mentioned,
for an old friend of the ladies called at the
mansion and the subject could not be brought up
in her presence. The next day she fully intended
to speak of the matter, but it seemed that she was
never alone with the twins for ten minutes at a
time. Either Cora or Henry remained within listening
distance and the girls wondered if they could
be suspicious.</p>
<p>The afternoon mail brought a note from Dave
Chamberlin, and for the time being Doris and
Kitty forgot the problems which troubled them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Doris,&rdquo; the note read, &ldquo;Marshmallow and
I think tomorrow would be a great day for that
picnic we planned. How about it? If we don&rsquo;t
hear from you to the contrary, we&rsquo;ll be at your
doorstep tomorrow morning. Don&rsquo;t worry about
grub. We&rsquo;ll bring enough for an army. Dave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a relief it will be to get away for a day,&rdquo;
Kitty declared. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to prevent our
going, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I heard Azalea say that Ronald was coming
tomorrow but that&rsquo;s all the more reason for me
to be away. He&rsquo;ll plague me about that loan and
I&rsquo;m not ready to give him the money yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not have to bother about fixing a lot of
things, either,&rdquo; Kitty went on. &ldquo;That will make
the picnic more enjoyable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t mind getting things ready when
I&rsquo;m at home, but when you&rsquo;re visiting, it&rsquo;s different.
Cora is so cross and she doesn&rsquo;t like to have any
one step into her kitchen, let alone use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder where we&rsquo;ll go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave probably knows some nice place.
Let&rsquo;s go tell the Misses Gates now that we are
going, and then if they should have any objection,
we could let Dave know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea had gone to her room but they found Iris
in the kitchen making out the market list. Upon
being told of the plan she at once approved of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never met this young man you call
Marshmallow,&rdquo; she smiled, &ldquo;but if he is at all like
your friend David I am sure I would approve of
him. By all means have your picnic, and Cora
will make you something nice to take with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like to trouble you,&rdquo; Doris murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be no trouble at all,&rdquo; Iris assured her.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t think of letting you go without a well-filled
basket. Cora, you might make one of your
pineapple cakes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re out of eggs,&rdquo; the housekeeper said crossly
without glancing up from the pan of potatoes which
she was peeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll add two dozen to the market list,&rdquo;
Iris said. &ldquo;What else will you want? Pickles and
olives, of course. And sandwiches. When I was
young, a picnic just wasn&rsquo;t a picnic without plenty
to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll have enough,&rdquo; Doris laughed.
&ldquo;Marshmallow&rsquo;s mother is a wonderful cook and he
always brings enough for six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>True to their word, Dave and Marshmallow
drove up to the mansion gate the next morning
shortly after ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d have been here sooner but Marshmallow
had so much food to pack, you know,&rdquo; Dave told
the girls as he helped them into the car.</p>
<p>It was an ideal day for a picnic, bright but not
too warm. Doris and Kitty were relieved that the
sky was clear, for the memory of the storm which
had nearly overtaken them on their last picnic was
still vivid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; Doris asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a place not far from here called
Eagle&rsquo;s Point. I though we might try that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds interesting,&rdquo; Kitty declared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>A short drive west of the town brought them to
a winding and heavily wooded road. Following
this they climbed a steep hill and came to a halt at
the brow of a cliff. Parking the car they climbed
out and walked over to the edge of the precipice
and looked down upon a lake, crystal clear and as
blue as the sky it reflected. Only a short distance
from the road a stone fireplace had been built and
picnic tables had been provided. A spring provided
clear, cold water.</p>
<p>The girls were delighted at the spot and announced
they would look no farther for a picnic
place. Dave and Marshmallow locked the car and
carried the heavy lunch hampers to the tables.
Marshmallow began to unpack the dishes but Doris
and Kitty stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to eat yet,&rdquo; they protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he drawled goodnaturedly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
what we came for, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we want to explore first,&rdquo; Doris declared.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lovely scenery, and then we must work
up an appetite for luncheon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine is already working,&rdquo; Marshmallow
grinned.</p>
<p>However, he placed the dishes back in the
hamper and started out with the others, managing
to pair himself with Kitty, which was not difficult,
as Doris and Dave were absorbed in each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>A steep path led down to the lake, and this the
party decided to explore. Slipping and sliding,
they finally reached the bottom of the decline
without mishap. There, finding a boat tied to an
old log, they decided it would be good sport to go
for a ride on the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any oars,&rdquo; Doris observed in disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need &rsquo;em,&rdquo; Marshmallow declared,
picking up a board. &ldquo;This will do almost as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By hunting around they found another board
nearly the same size, and with Dave and Marshmallow
each wielding one of the improvised oars,
they courageously set out in the little boat. The
paddles were not very effective and the young men
worked like Trojans to propel the craft a few yards.
For the most part they were content to drift with
the wind.</p>
<p>Tiring of this sport, they brought the boat to
shore and left it tied to the log.</p>
<p>The party was about to climb the hill again
when Doris noticed a path leading around the lake.
She proposed that they continue their trip of exploration,
and the suggestion was greeted with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The four were forced to proceed single file, for
the path was narrow and branches of low-hanging
trees formed an archway above their heads. Presently,
Doris who was in the lead stopped short and
gave an exclamation of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Kitty demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve come to the jumping off place! And
just see what I&rsquo;ve discovered. A cave!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Kitty thought her chum was only joking, but as
she came up behind her she saw for herself the
tiny opening in the side of the cliff. Dave and
Marshmallow crowded up, the latter becoming
greatly excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jumping snakes!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I never
heard about this cave. I wonder what&rsquo;s inside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thrust his head in at the opening but could
see nothing, as his eyes were unaccustomed to the
darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we only had a flashlight!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;It
would be fun to explore it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s inhabited by bears,&rdquo; Kitty suggested
nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard of any around here,&rdquo; Marshmallow
insisted. &ldquo;Say, we can&rsquo;t go home without seeing
the inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s a flashlight in the car,&rdquo; Dave
told him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls and Marshmallow waited impatiently
for Dave to return. Presently, he came back with
the flashlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be grand if we&rsquo;d find buried treasure?&rdquo;
Doris laughed. &ldquo;I could use some money all
right, and I don&rsquo;t know of any more delightful way
to obtain it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not really hope that any such adventure
would befall them, but Kitty&rsquo;s eyes grew round at
the mere mention of treasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s to go first?&rdquo; Doris asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me,&rdquo; Marshmallow begged.</p>
<p>Dave handed him the flashlight, and after an
instant&rsquo;s hesitation he again thrust his head and
shoulders through the opening. It was only a
small aperture, and Marshmallow grunted as he
squeezed through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too fat,&rdquo; Doris called after him. &ldquo;You
may never get out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no response from the inside of the
cave and Kitty, suddenly becoming alarmed, called
anxiously:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marshmallow! Marshmallow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here,&rdquo; came a muffled voice. &ldquo;Come
on in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; Doris demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like a cracking big cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat reassured, the girls wormed their way
through the opening and Dave brought up the
rear. It was pitch dark inside, but the beam of
Marshmallow&rsquo;s light furnished a faint illumination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; Marshmallow commanded.</p>
<p>He led the way deeper into the cavern. The
cave consisted of two chambers, and as the four
friends entered the second room Marshmallow
flashed his light over the ceiling. They saw
strange formations resembling icicles hanging from
above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stalactites!&rdquo; Doris exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they odd?&rdquo; Kitty cried. &ldquo;What causes
them anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read that stalactites are caused by the
dripping of water which contains carbonate of
lime,&rdquo; Doris explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Folks, I guess we&rsquo;ve seen all the sights,&rdquo; Marshmallow,
who had gone on a short way ahead, announced.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as large a cave as I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No buried treasure, either,&rdquo; Kitty murmured
in disappointment. &ldquo;Still, the stalactites are interesting.
Imagine living this close and not knowing
anything about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was cold inside the cave and, being without
wraps, the girls began to shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Doris proposed.</p>
<p>Once outside the warm sunshine seemed more
welcome than before. During the excursion into
the cave, Dave had appeared less interested than
the others, and now, observing the smile on his
face, Doris&rsquo;s suspicions were aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave Chamberlin!&rdquo; she accused. &ldquo;You knew
about that cave all the time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe I had heard about it,&rdquo; he grinned,
&ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t want to spoil the fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were all so excited and silly,&rdquo; Doris laughed.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a path leading right up here! And we
didn&rsquo;t think a thing about it. Of course other
folks know about the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, it was fun anyway,&rdquo; Marshmallow
said. &ldquo;So much exertion made me hungry, though.
When do we eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would ask <i>that</i>,&rdquo; Doris bantered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
willing if the rest of you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The climb back up the steep hill was not easy,
and by the time Doris and Kitty reached the top
they were nearly out of breath. While they were
resting under a shade tree, Dave and Marshmallow
brought water from the spring and started
a fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we cooking?&rdquo; Doris asked with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steak,&rdquo; Marshmallow told her, smacking his
lips. &ldquo;And boy, do I know how to cook it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother must have been giving you lessons,&rdquo;
Doris smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, don&rsquo;t you think I ever went camping? I
can cook a lot of things.&rdquo; He opened a hamper
and began to lift out various covered dishes. &ldquo;Just
look at all this stuff Ma sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the steak was sizzling over the red hot
fire, the girls spread the table cloth and unwrapped
the various packages. They were appalled at the
outlay of food. &ldquo;Enough for an army!&rdquo; Doris
groaned. Always an excellent cook, Mrs. Mallow
had quite outdone herself on this occasion. Salads
crisp and inviting in nests of lettuce, pie, gigantic
cream puffs with Marshmallow&rsquo;s favorite chocolate
filling, baked beans, deviled eggs and lemonade
were but a suggestion of all the good things with
which the cloth was loaded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never be able to eat all of this,&rdquo; Doris
declared in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we will,&rdquo; Marshmallow grinned. &ldquo;Just
give me a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others were forced to admit that he did do
remarkably well, for long after they had finished
eating he continued to blissfully gorge sandwiches,
cake and cream puffs with an apparently unappeased
appetite. At last, however, the plump lad
was forced to acknowledge his Waterloo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t finish it,&rdquo; he said regretfully.
&ldquo;What a shame to lug so much back with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll feel up to it after you&rsquo;ve rested a
bit,&rdquo; Dave suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a contented groan he stretched himself out
under a shade tree and closed his eyes. Dave
helped the girls clean up the picnic things.</p>
<p>After that, they sat around and talked. Doris
was induced to sing and they all joined in, even
Marshmallow, whose voice was gruff and seldom
on the right key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that last sandwich pressing against my
larynx,&rdquo; he apologized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris, you have a wonderful voice,&rdquo; Dave
praised soberly. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve been told that
by every one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not by every one,&rdquo; Doris laughed. &ldquo;It will
probably take years before my voice develops to
its fullest capacity. That&rsquo;s what my teacher
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead set upon a career, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
Dave asked, a strange light shining in his eyes as
he gazed thoughtfully at her curly head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I want to sing in Grand Opera some
day. Perhaps my ambitions are greater than my
ability!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ll make it, and if that&rsquo;s what you want,
more power to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris glanced quickly at her friend, and as
quickly turned away as she saw the expression on
his face. She was further embarrassed as she
realized that Marshmallow and Kitty were aware
of what had been passing through Dave&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Hastily she arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;d better be starting back?
Dave and Marshmallow have a long drive ahead of
them and it&rsquo;s getting late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t eaten all of the sandwiches yet,&rdquo;
Marshmallow protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then hurry and we&rsquo;ll wait for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t now. Oh, well, I suppose we can
cart them home. Maybe Dave and I can eat them
on the way back to Chilton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean <i>you</i> can,&rdquo; Dave corrected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>As they were driving slowly back toward the
mansion, Doris thought of Ronald Trent, and
frowned. For the last few hours she had been
having so much fun that she had not once considered
the problem which troubled her, but now
she decided to mention the matter to Dave. Perhaps
he could offer helpful advice. Accordingly,
she told him of the proposition which the Misses
Gates had made.</p>
<p>Dave listened quietly until she had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be all right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it sounds
sort of queer to me. I don&rsquo;t like that fellow
Trent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my cousin, Dave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not own him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I haven&rsquo;t exactly,&rdquo; Doris admitted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
hard to believe he really is a relative of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;ll be at the mansion when we get
back,&rdquo; Kitty sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll want his answer about the loan. Oh,
dear, I don&rsquo;t know what to do. I think I&rsquo;ll have
Jake bring it to the mansion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad idea,&rdquo; Dave approved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll come along to chaperone him,&rdquo; Marshmallow
interposed. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t know what to
do with so many ladies. He&rsquo;ll need me to help
him handle the situation masterfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do come,&rdquo; Doris urged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just leave it to me,&rdquo; ejaculated Marshmallow,
throwing out his chest manfully, and displaying the
cords of muscles in his upper arm, rolling up his
sleeve playfully. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Marshmallow, you&rsquo;ve got a good opinion
of yourself, haven&rsquo;t you? Especially after eating
all those sandwiches. My, but wouldn&rsquo;t I hate to
get into a fight with you!&rdquo; and Dave jokingly
jostled him as though to test his skill as a fighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay off me, Dave! Who do you think I am,
Jack Dempsey?&rdquo; So saying, Marshmallow pretended
to be very much frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a friendly fight, old boy. But anyway,
girls, you see you have two champions who will
stand by you to the death, to the bitter end, if
need be, &lsquo;&rsquo;til death us do part.&rsquo;&rdquo; And with that
closing bit of assurance they struck an attitude of
utter devotion, entwining their arms about each
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You silly boys,&rdquo; giggled Kitty, &ldquo;perhaps we
will need you, so keep in fighting trim until such a
time might arise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your service, fair ladies,&rdquo; said Marshmallow
solemnly, taking off his hat, and making a sweeping
bow before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jake can be your second,&rdquo; suggested Doris.</p>
<p>And so it was arranged in regard to bringing the
much-desired loan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Dave and Marshmallow left the girls at the
mansion gate, but as it was growing late declined
an invitation to go inside. Doris and Kitty
watched them drive away and then reluctantly
walked up the path toward the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ronald&rsquo;s car isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; Doris observed in relief,
&ldquo;so if he came today, he must have left before
we returned. At least I won&rsquo;t be bothered about
that loan until tomorrow, and I can give him a
definite answer then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty agreed with her friend that there was no
further need of troubling their minds about Ronald
Trent and the loan, at least not tonight, so they
slowly sauntered up the pathway toward the old
mansion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">AN UNUSUAL PROCEDURE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to speak of it, but Ronald will be
here directly after breakfast and I am afraid he
expects a definite answer about the loan. We dislike
to rush you but the dear boy is so impatient
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea allowed her words to trail off and smiled
apologetically at Doris, who sat opposite her at the
breakfast table. Iris looked down at her plate to
hide her embarrassment. Both ladies were very
proud and found it difficult to bring up the subject
of money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we had something of our own that we
could sell, we wouldn&rsquo;t think of asking you for this
favor,&rdquo; Iris murmured.</p>
<p>Doris had been awaiting an opportunity to bring
up the subject of the paper which Cora and Henry
Sully had mentioned. The housekeeper had returned
to the kitchen and she decided to risk being
overheard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t want to mortgage your
house,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;What a pity you haven&rsquo;t
any land or stock of any kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As it happens, we have some oil company bonds
but they aren&rsquo;t worth anything. Iris and I were
very gullible to buy them. Millions have been lost
in the oil fields but we didn&rsquo;t realize it until too
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oil bonds, did you say?&rdquo; Doris demanded
eagerly.</p>
<p>Iris nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we lost several thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you still have the certificates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iris did not reply, for just at that moment Cora
Sully appeared to remove the dishes and the Misses
Gates made it a point never to discuss personal
affairs or business before their servants. Upon
leaving the dining room Doris started to bring up
the subject again but before she could do so, Ronald
Trent was announced.</p>
<p>He appeared less affable than usual and lost no
time in bringing up the matter of the loan. The
Misses Gates looked doubtfully at Doris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already sent for the money,&rdquo; she told
them. &ldquo;It should be here tomorrow or the next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sent?&rdquo; Ronald asked blankly. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t
get the bank draft the way I told you to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; Doris returned innocently. &ldquo;I
thought it would be so much easier to have Jake
bring the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who is Jake?&rdquo; the man questioned suspiciously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he works for my uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ronald Trent seemed to relax at this, but it was
evident to both Kitty and Doris that he was far
from pleased at the way the matter had been handled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all right,&rdquo; he said grumpily, &ldquo;but he&rsquo;d
better get here with the money tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Ronald!&rdquo; Azalea reproved gently. &ldquo;I
think it&rsquo;s lovely of Doris to offer her money, and
we mustn&rsquo;t seem ungrateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! It&rsquo;s just a straight business deal.
She knows she&rsquo;ll get every cent of it back and with
interest! Come on, if you&rsquo;re going with me! I
can&rsquo;t wait around much longer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea and Iris looked a trifle crushed at this
abrupt statement, but they hurried away to get
their coats and hats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must leave you alone for awhile,&rdquo; Azalea
said apologetically to the girls. &ldquo;We have a little
business to attend to at the bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s get going!&rdquo; Ronald urged. In
the doorway he turned back toward Doris. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
fail to let that fellow Jake know he&rsquo;s to bring the
money tomorrow. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; Doris returned dryly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>After the three had left the mansion, she and
Kitty took stock of affairs. They were amazed
that the Misses Gates had gone with Ronald, for it
was only on very rare occasions that they ever set
foot beyond the high hedge which surrounded
Locked Gates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re under that man&rsquo;s influence entirely,&rdquo;
Kitty declared.</p>
<p>Doris nodded soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s getting more sure of himself every
minute. Why, he spoke positively mean to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why they went to the bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely to give him more money, though
from what they said, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re practically
destitute. Oh, it&rsquo;s a shame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do, Doris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I have a feeling things are
about to reach a climax. Let&rsquo;s go for a walk and
perhaps we can think of some way to show Ronald
up in his true light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the girls went to their room for their hats,
they met Cora and Henry just starting up the stairway
with broom, dustpan and mop. Since it was
an unusual sight to see the two working together
unless the Misses Gates were at hand to watch
them, Kitty and Doris could not hide their surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought we&rsquo;d do some housecleanin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Cora
murmured, though the girls had asked for no explanation.
&ldquo;Thinkin&rsquo; of going out, were you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; Doris replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going for a
walk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>They found their hats and left the house. However,
they had walked but a short distance when
Doris stopped short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kit, I have an idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spill it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never have a better opportunity than this
to visit that little crippled girl on the attic floor.
The twins are away and the Sullys are cleaning the
wing on the other side of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we dare?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? After all, it&rsquo;s no crime to visit a
little girl. I feel dreadfully sorry for her, and then
I&rsquo;d like to ask her a few questions, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Kitty agreed.</p>
<p>Returning to the mansion, they quietly entered
by the side door and stole softly up the stairway.
They could hear Henry and Cora cleaning the
rooms occupied by the Misses Gates. The doors
were closed so they knew they had not been seen.
Turning into their own wing they moved noiselessly
down the hall until they came to the stairway
leading to the third floor. Glancing back to
make certain they were not being observed, they
crept up the stairs and paused before the Sully
suite.</p>
<p>Hesitating an instant, they pushed open the door
and stepped into the sitting room. As they moved
over toward the bedroom, they heard some one crying
and knew that it was Etta.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>Doris and Kitty quietly opened the door and entered.
At first the girl on the bed did not hear
them, but as they took a step toward her, she
turned her head.</p>
<p>The girls were shocked at her appearance. She
was not an ugly child, but her face was pinched
and drawn. The hands which rested above the
soiled comforter were thin and scrawny. Her hair
did not look as though it had been combed that day.</p>
<p>The girls did not know just what to do or say, so
stunned were they upon seeing this strange little
creature gazing so pitifully and wonderingly at
them. She was not frightened, but she was very
much amazed. Why, these girls were among the
few persons she had seen in all her years of seclusion.</p>
<p>Her great eyes looked out upon them&mdash;pleading,
tragic, wounded eyes, like those of a timid, shy
young animal. The girls held their breath!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never expected this,&rdquo; awesomely whispered
Kitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; responded Doris.</p>
<p>A hush fell over the two young girls.</p>
<p>The old mansion itself furnished the background
and what a melodramatic setting! The mighty
Locked Gates, surrounded by the weird trees that
sighed and moaned in the night as they swayed and
tossed restlessly as though exhausted from their
unceasing vigil!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>The vivacious chums from Barry Manor were
suddenly confronted with a side of life which they
were unable to understand. Could this child be
the neglected daughter of Cora and Henry Sully?</p>
<p>As Kitty and Doris advanced to the bedside,
Etta stared at them in astonishment. Shut up in
one room for nearly twenty years she had never
seen any one her own age. Only Azalea and Iris
had ever visited her and so she had come to think
of a world peopled only by adults. Her parents,
Henry and Cora Sully, had never taken the trouble
to educate her and the only lessons she had ever
received were taken from the Bible passages which
the Misses Gates read aloud. Though in actual
age she was older than either Doris or Kitty, mentally
she remained a child. Now, as she viewed
the girls and noticed their white dresses, it seemed
to her that surely she must be gazing upon two
angels.</p>
<p>Too moved for words, an expression of awe and
rapture came over her face; she stretched out her
thin hand toward Doris.</p>
<p>The two girls took a step nearer toward the bed.
The coverlet of the quaint patch-work pattern was
faded from many washings and the muslin was
yellowed. A twisted, knotted handkerchief had
dropped carelessly on a narrow strip of well-worn
rag carpet. The whole picture was a far cry from
anything that the two girls from boarding school
had ever seen or expected to find at Locked Gates.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>The poor, unfortunate girl was gowned in an
old-fashioned, high-necked night-dress. A bit of
yellowed crocheting finished the neck-line, no doubt
the work of her grandmother, the dressmaker, who
had been the seamstress for the Gates family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; said Doris, smiling sweetly in
an effort to be friendly at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are visiting here,&rdquo; added Kitty, also making
an effort to be cheerful and to put the cripple
at ease with her most charming manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a lovely sunny day, my dear. Let me
raise the shade so that the light can come in and
cheer up the room.&rdquo; Doris raised the curtain
which crinkled and creaked as the sunlight streamed
into the bedroom in the attic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you can see the fleecy clouds,&rdquo; chirped
Doris, &ldquo;and pretend you are floating and resting,
honey, on one of those billowy boats up there in
that deep, blue sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty laughed in a silvery, tinkling tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe we could almost see Barry Manor today,
the air is so clear and there is no sign of haze
or fog to obstruct one&rsquo;s view. I should have
brought my field-glasses with me, Dory, and then
we could see our Alma Mater, maybe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris could not restrain a laugh, so impossible
did it appear to her that one could see miles and
miles, even though the air were clear as crystal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>A smile, a bit wavering and uncertain, flickered
about the crippled girl&rsquo;s mouth, as she listened to
these two young girls, dressed in white, smiling
happily, and the sunlight touching their hair with
gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you talk to us, dear?&rdquo; asked Kitty, moving
closer toward the bedside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dearie,&rdquo; urged Doris. &ldquo;Tell us about
yourself. We want to be your friends, and we
want to make you happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be an angel,&rdquo; she whispered in a
tense voice. &ldquo;Can you make me well? Can you
give me new limbs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gently Doris stroked the little hand and pushed
the tangled hair from her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t angels,&rdquo; she said kindly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
just girls and very human ones at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls?&rdquo; Etta echoed blankly.</p>
<p>The word had no significance to her. All her
life she had been shut away having been associated
entirely with her parents and the Misses Gates.
Her bed was not even by the window. Consequently,
she had never been able to look down
upon the street where children played.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you get lonesome here all by yourself?&rdquo;
Doris asked the girl.</p>
<p>Etta nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it seems as though I can&rsquo;t stand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we can arrange to take you downstairs
some afternoon,&rdquo; suggested Kitty hopefully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I cannot walk!&rdquo; Tears came into the sad
eyes of Etta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t cry, dearie,&rdquo; soothed Doris. &ldquo;We
easily could manage to take you down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be fun, Etta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we have the cutest little dog we found.
We call him Wags because he is so good-natured
and wags his tail so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Etta&rsquo;s tears were gone, almost instantly, as this
new world of cheer was opened to her by the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be your guardian angels. Would you be
willing to have us come and help while away the
lonesome hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no time for further questions, for
suddenly Doris and Kitty heard footsteps on the
stairway.</p>
<p>Some one was coming!</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be caught!&rdquo; Kitty whispered, starting
quickly toward the door.</p>
<p>Doris caught her by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t make it! We must hide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frantically, the girls looked about the room.
They felt that they were trapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The closet,&rdquo; Doris hissed.</p>
<p>As they moved on tiptoe toward it, Etta held out
her hands toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away,&rdquo; she begged, almost tearfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; Doris warned. &ldquo;Just be patient and your
&lsquo;angels&rsquo; will come back to see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>With that she closed the door of the closet and
the two girls crouched against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be almost certain to give us away,&rdquo; Kitty
whispered fearfully. &ldquo;What a mess we&rsquo;re in now!
Fancy trying to explain our way out of it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">A NARROW ESCAPE</span></h2>
<p>Scarcely daring to breathe naturally lest they
be discovered, Doris and Kitty crouched in the
dark closet. In their haste to hide they had left
the door a trifle ajar and though this added to the
risk of being detected, it was too late to close it
tightly.</p>
<p>Already they could hear some one in the outer
sitting room and a moment later the bedroom
door was thrown open. Henry Sully came in. He
seemed strangely excited and was out of breath
from hurrying up the stairs so rapidly.</p>
<p>Peeping out through the crack of the door, the
girls saw that he was carrying two long, fat envelopes
in his hand.</p>
<p>Rushing across the room, with scarcely a glance
directed at Etta, Henry pulled a heavy suitcase
from under the bed. Opening it, he placed the
two envelopes carefully in the bottom and folded
clothing over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought we never would find &rsquo;em,&rdquo; the girls
heard him mutter.</p>
<p>As he bent over to fasten the suitcase again, Etta
plucked at his coat sleeve to attract his attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I just saw two beautiful
angels. They came here to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inside the closet, Kitty and Doris gripped each
others&rsquo; hands nervously. They feared that Etta
was about to expose them. What Henry would
do if he found them hiding there, they dared not
think.</p>
<p>However, the man paid scant attention to what
the crippled girl was saying. Impatiently he
jerked away from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that silly prattling,&rdquo; he commanded.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were shocked at this cruel speech, but
what followed left them even more stunned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might as well know it now as later,&rdquo; Henry
told Etta viciously. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re tired of looking after
you night and day. All you&rsquo;re good for is to eat
and make up fancy fairy tales about angels and
the like. This is a hard world and it&rsquo;s time you
learned its ways. Cora and I are going to git out
of here pretty soon and, when we do, you can shift
for yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Etta stared at her father as though unable to
comprehend what he had said. Then as it slowly
dawned upon her that she was to be left to a cruel
fate, a shudder convulsed her body. With a
frightened cry, she caught Henry by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t leave me alone,&rdquo; she begged piteously.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me to die!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; Henry snarled, pushing her back upon
the bed as she endeavored to sit up. &ldquo;I tell you
we&rsquo;re through with you and it won&rsquo;t do any good
to be squawking about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shoving the suitcase under the bed with his foot,
he turned toward the door. Etta stretched out her
thin little arms and entreated him to come back.
Henry laughed harshly and slammed the door shut.</p>
<p>Etta became almost hysterical in her grief. She
wailed and sobbed and beat upon the pillow with
her puny fists, but, if Henry heard, he was not in
the least affected. Doris and Kitty could hear him
hurrying down the stairs to the second floor.</p>
<p>Satisfied that the coast was clear, they quickly
came out of their hiding place. Filled with compassion
for Etta, they rushed to her bedside. As
the girl saw them, she tried to stifle her sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, dear,&rdquo; Doris tried to comfort her, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
cry. We&rsquo;ll see that no harm comes to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t let my father go away and leave
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless you want him to,&rdquo; Doris assured
her gently. Under her breath she said to Kitty:
&ldquo;It would almost be better for her if he did
leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t have any worse care,&rdquo; Kitty
agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>As soon as they had quieted Etta and had made
her more comfortable against the pillows, the girls
cast an appraising glance about the room. The
scene which they had just witnessed made them
wonder anew what mischief Henry and Cora Sully
were plotting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They <i>are</i> planning to get away from here,&rdquo;
Doris said to her chum in a low voice. &ldquo;That suitcase
under the bed was packed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And everything has been taken from the closet,&rdquo;
Kitty added. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Cora&rsquo;s suitcase back of
that couch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s packed, too. That means they intend to
leave soon. Kitty, we&rsquo;ll have to keep our wits
about us now. And the first thing to do is to get
away from this room, before we&rsquo;re caught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls had talked so rapidly and in such a
low tone that Etta had not heard them, but now
as she sensed that they were about to leave, she
began to sob again. Doris dropped down on the
bed and took her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re only
going away for a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come back tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you must be careful not to say anything
about having seen us. If you do, we may
not be able to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; Etta promised solemnly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Hastily saying goodbye, the girls slipped out of
the bedroom and down the stairs to the second
floor. As they entered their own room they could
hear Cora and Henry Sully moving about on the
floor below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly finished their housecleaning
quickly enough,&rdquo; Kitty observed.</p>
<p>Doris took care to close the door and then,
dropping down on the bed beside her chum, regarded
her soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my candid opinion that was only an excuse,
Kit. It wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if they were
hunting for something in the Misses Gates&rsquo;s
rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to know. Say! You
don&rsquo;t suppose it could have been those two envelopes
he put in his suitcase?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t we look in the suitcase when we
were there? If Cora and Henry are stealing, we
ought to know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t have discovered much if we had
looked,&rdquo; Kitty declared. &ldquo;I noticed those envelopes
were sealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s so. We really haven&rsquo;t any excuse
for opening sealed envelopes. If we did, it would
be just our luck that whatever it was belonged to
Henry after all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was up to some mischief today, Dory. You
remember how guilty he looked when we met him
on the stairs. And he&rsquo;s the laziest man alive. It
isn&rsquo;t likely he&rsquo;d start out to clean house unless he
had been told to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he was hunting for something, all right. I
wonder if it could have been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not finish, for Kitty caught her by the
hand and dragged her from the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ruby ring!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Maybe that
was what they were after!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anxiously she felt under the mattress and when
her hand failed to touch the box, began to paw
frantically at the blankets to get them out of the
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, don&rsquo;t tear that bed to pieces,&rdquo; Doris
scolded. &ldquo;Let me find the ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran her hand under the mattress and to
Kitty&rsquo;s intense relief, brought forth the tiny box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish the Misses Gates had taken their ring,&rdquo;
she sighed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost five pounds since we started
looking after it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ring is the least of my troubles just now,&rdquo;
Doris told her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m convinced that Henry and
Cora are involved in a plot against the Misses
Gates, but just what it is I haven&rsquo;t been able to
fathom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better tell the ladies everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in rather a delicate position, Kit. The
Sullys are trusted servants and Azalea and Iris
might believe them before they would us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are we going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s keep close watch of Cora and Henry and
wait for them to show their hand. If they try to
get away, we can expose them, and then if they&rsquo;re
caught red-handed, the Gates sisters will have to
believe us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably the best way,&rdquo; Kitty agreed.
Replacing the ring under the mattress, they went
downstairs. They were just in time to see Ronald
Trent driving away from the mansion after depositing
the old ladies at their door.</p>
<p>Entering the living room, Azalea and Iris sank
down into the nearest chairs without bothering to
remove their hats. They appeared agitated and
exhausted but offered no explanation for their condition.
Doris and Kitty guessed that Ronald had
wheedled money from them and perhaps had
abused them for not giving him more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ronald is coming back tomorrow,&rdquo; Iris said
presently, speaking to Doris. &ldquo;You are quite sure
your messenger will be here with the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I feel sure Jake will come. I sent
word several days ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad,&rdquo; Iris murmured in relief. &ldquo;Ronald
is leaving tomorrow and we must have the
money ready for him or lose the inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; murmured Doris thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We probably won&rsquo;t have his company much
longer, then,&rdquo; surmised Kitty, winking coyly at
Doris.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Azalea stroked her forehead as if perplexed and
perhaps a bit worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never dreamed that money need cause us such
concern. We cannot afford to lose this inheritance
now. I have so much faith in the son of John
Trent. I want him to go away happy and satisfied
that we have not failed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris pricked up her ears at this bit of information.
So Ronald was leaving, too! It seemed
that affairs certainly were destined to come to a
climax on the following day. How glad she was
that she had asked Jake to come. If only he did
not fail her!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">AN ACCUSATION</span></h2>
<p>On the following morning Doris and Kitty arose
earlier than usual. They wandered about the
grounds until time for breakfast, but when they
were called to the dining room by Cora, the Misses
Gates had not put in their appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well sit down,&rdquo; the housekeeper
told them. &ldquo;Things are getting cold and I&rsquo;m in a
hurry to get around this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, we&rsquo;d prefer to wait,&rdquo; Doris told her.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so unusual for the Misses Gates to be late.
We&rsquo;re usually the guilty ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were about to go outside again when they
heard some one coming down the stairs. It was
Azalea and the girls saw at once that she was dreadfully
agitated. Iris came after her and she, too,
was excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one has been tampering with our things!&rdquo;
Azalea cried. &ldquo;We have separate desks in our
rooms. A few minutes ago when I went to get a
check book from the pigeon hole, I found that
everything had been rifled!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My desk is the same way,&rdquo; Iris declared angrily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was anything taken?&rdquo; Doris questioned quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, several important papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris and Kitty, not greatly surprised at this
news, glanced significantly at each other. The twins,
observing them, regarded the girls rather sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was any one here yesterday while we were
gone?&rdquo; Azalea questioned Cora who had remained
in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am. There wasn&rsquo;t any one in that
wing all day&mdash;except of course the young ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Doris demanded. &ldquo;We
never set foot in that part of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The housekeeper merely stared at them in
feigned astonishment and shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand who would want the papers,&rdquo;
Iris said quietly, but she looked queerly at Doris
and Kitty. &ldquo;Of course, the bonds may be more
valuable than we thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In all the time I&rsquo;ve been at the mansion nothing
like this ever happened,&rdquo; Cora murmured.</p>
<p>Kitty and Doris cast irritated glances at the
housekeeper. They realized all too well that she
was trying to build up an alibi for herself by calling
attention to her past service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it would clear up matters if you girls
would tell the housekeeper what you were doing
yesterday,&rdquo; Azalea suggested in her gentle voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;we weren&rsquo;t doing much&mdash;of anything,&rdquo;
Kitty stammered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>The question embarrassed her. She could not
very well tell the Misses Gates that she and Doris
had taken it into their heads to explore every nook
and cranny of the old mansion. It would appear
to the ladies that they had abused their hospitality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were in our room part of the time,&rdquo; Doris
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where were you the rest of it?&rdquo; Cora demanded
harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t in the left wing at any rate!&rdquo; Doris
retorted, with growing indignation.</p>
<p>Azalea and Iris, greatly disturbed, looked uncertainly
from one to the other. They did not
know what to say or how to handle the difficult
situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call Henry in,&rdquo; Cora announced. &ldquo;He can
tell you where these girls were yesterday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stepped to the door and called to her husband
who was in the garden. He came readily and, as
the girls had expected, corroborated Cora&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right after you ladies went to the bank they
said they were going for a walk,&rdquo; he told the twins.
&ldquo;They started out but as soon as they thought they
had thrown us off the track they stole back into the
house. My wife and I heard them go into the left
wing and knowin&rsquo; they had no business there we
sort of listened. They went into your room, Miss
Azalea, and closed the door. Later we heard &rsquo;em
in the room adjoining.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can this be true?&rdquo; Azalea asked the girls, her
voice trembling with suppressed emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Doris returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What isn&rsquo;t true?&rdquo; a loud voice demanded, and
they all turned to see Ronald Trent standing in
the doorway.</p>
<p>To the embarrassment of the girls he was quickly
told of the accusation against them. They knew
they could expect no help from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; he said, masterfully throwing an
arm around the shoulders of each of the ladies.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take on so about it. I&rsquo;ll straighten this
matter out in a minute for you. Just leave everything
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ronald,&rdquo; Iris murmured gratefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in such a muddle,&rdquo; Azalea added, &ldquo;and
we don&rsquo;t want to falsely accuse any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Just let me handle this in my
own way. Now, Cora and Henry are old servants,
aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cora is the daughter of our former dressmaker,&rdquo;
Azalea explained. &ldquo;She and her husband have
been with us several years now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Years! And how long have you known Doris
Force and her friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we never met them until a few days ago,&rdquo;
Iris answered reluctantly.</p>
<p>Ronald nodded in grim satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You accuse your own cousin&mdash;&rdquo; Iris began, but
Ronald interrupted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my first duty is to you and to Miss Azalea.
I will not protect my own relatives at your expense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goaded beyond endurance, Doris faced Ronald
Trent defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call me no cousin of yours!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I believe
you&rsquo;re nothing but a bluff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s face went white with anger and for
an instant Doris thought he meant to strike her.
Instead he laughed harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say such things!&rdquo; Azalea commanded
sternly. &ldquo;Ronald is the son of our dear friend,
John Trent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him prove it,&rdquo; Doris cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young lady,&rdquo; Ronald told her angrily. &ldquo;The
burden of proof is upon you. Prove that you
didn&rsquo;t take those papers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I will!&rdquo; Doris announced with sudden
decision. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you where the papers are!&rdquo;
At her words, Cora and Henry Sully recoiled a
step, but the Misses Gates did not observe their
guilty action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us!&rdquo; Azalea commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Ronald echoed, but with less force.
&ldquo;Spin your fairy tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris faced the three conspirators defiantly.
She pointed an accusing finger at Henry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The papers are in his suitcase!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; Henry snarled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth and you know it,&rdquo; Kitty confirmed.
&ldquo;We can prove it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know the papers are in Henry&rsquo;s
suitcase?&rdquo; Iris questioned doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we saw them there yesterday,&rdquo; Doris
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then you admit you were snooping around?&rdquo;
Ronald demanded triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t snooping,&rdquo; Doris retorted indignantly.
&ldquo;We had a very good reason for going to
the Sullys&rsquo; suite, and as it turns out, it was fortunate
for the Misses Gates that we did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You went to the Sully suite yesterday?&rdquo; Azalea,
gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we heard Etta crying and sobbing. We
didn&rsquo;t know what was wrong&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw Etta?&rdquo; Iris asked.</p>
<p>She dropped weakly into a chair and for a moment
looked as though she might faint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought no one in the world knew about
her,&rdquo; she said very low. &ldquo;For her sake we have
kept Cora and Henry here during all these years.
What will the neighbors think if they learn
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shall never hear it from us,&rdquo; Doris replied,
&ldquo;but we are unwilling to permit the Sullys
to desert her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy!&rdquo; Henry shouted. &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t
think of leaving her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why are your suitcases packed?&rdquo; Doris
demanded.</p>
<p>Henry could not answer, and Ronald, seeing that
the man was throwing suspicion upon himself,
stepped again into the breach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this talk is getting us nowhere,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Obviously, the girls took the papers from the
desks and are only trying to save themselves.&rdquo; He
turned to the Misses Gates and a false note came
into his voice. &ldquo;Of course, I realize that you
ladies regret this exceedingly and no doubt feel
sorry for them. Under the circumstances I suggest
that the matter be dropped without placing
charges against them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter will not be dropped!&rdquo; Doris cried.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sift it to the bottom right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the easiest way is to look in Henry&rsquo;s suitcase,&rdquo;
Kitty added. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the papers there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A less clever man than Ronald Trent would have
lost his temper, for well he knew that he was treading
upon dangerous ground. Realizing that the
Misses Gates would judge him as much by his
manner as by his words, he faced the girls with
the calm and dignity of a judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are only trying to shield yourselves,&rdquo; he
told them sternly. &ldquo;Your entire story has been a
series of lies!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Doris, throwing back her lovely
head and looking her accuser straight in the eye.
Kitty thought never had she seen her chum quite
so beautiful, so courageously poised for one so inexperienced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak the truth!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">FACE TO FACE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I speak the truth,&rdquo; Doris insisted indignantly,
&ldquo;and furthermore, Ronald Trent, I am convinced
that you are nothing but an impostor. You are
plotting with Henry and Cora Sully to swindle
these people&mdash;out of everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris!&rdquo; Iris remonstrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s lost her mind!&rdquo; Cora exclaimed.</p>
<p>Thoroughly aroused at the false accusations
made against herself and her chum, Doris could
not have remained quiet had she wished. However,
she forced herself to speak calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not have a cent of my money when
Jake arrives with it,&rdquo; she told Ronald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; he returned, glaring back at her.
&ldquo;You have already lent the money to the Misses
Gates and they have promised it to me. Haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea and Iris, pale with excitement, nodded
their heads miserably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve given you nearly every cent we have of
our own,&rdquo; Iris admitted, &ldquo;and we did promise you
Doris&rsquo;s money. We trusted you&mdash;and now these
dreadful accusations.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What can you expect when you bring strangers
into the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we needed Doris&rsquo;s help so much, Ronald,&rdquo;
Azalea protested, &ldquo;and she isn&rsquo;t the same as a
stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are willing to accept her word against
mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ronald, please don&rsquo;t take that attitude,&rdquo;
Iris pleaded. &ldquo;We want to believe you both, but
surely something is wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ronald laughed shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you once I&rsquo;d straighten out everything.
Just send these intruders on their way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea and Iris exchanged uneasy glances.
They did not know what to do. For the sake of
John Trent, the man they loved, they felt they
could not be disloyal to his son, and yet they were
reluctant to ask Doris and Kitty to leave, particularly
as they had been given a special invitation
to visit their home. The girls had told a very
straightforward story, but on the other hand Cora
and Henry were old servants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do,&rdquo; Iris murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing to do and that&rsquo;s to send
these girls packing,&rdquo; Ronald told her firmly. &ldquo;Let
me handle this for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we want those important papers back,&rdquo;
Azalea protested. &ldquo;Tell us where they are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; Ronald demanded
harshly. &ldquo;These girls have probably hid them
somewhere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that isn&rsquo;t true!&rdquo; Doris snapped.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve told you where you&rsquo;ll find the papers, but
apparently you&rsquo;re afraid to look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ronald scowled. He had been trying to induce
the Misses Gates to send Doris and Kitty away
before they thought of bringing up again the subject
of the lost property. He realized that the
girls had it in their power to place him in an extremely
awkward position. He hoped to bluff his
way through by appealing to the sympathies of the
two ladies.</p>
<p>Cora and Henry paled as Doris reminded Azalea
and Iris of the suitcase. The housekeeper trembled
and clung to her husband for support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look at them,&rdquo; Ronald declared. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
crushed at the accusation against their good names.
Here they have served long and faithfully and now
these girls try to brand them as thieves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ronald, we aren&rsquo;t branding any one,&rdquo; Iris
said at the point of tears. &ldquo;We only want to get
at the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Doris and Kitty were at their wits&rsquo; end. In
every manner possible they had tried to convince
the Misses Gates of their innocence, but they realized
that no matter how strong was the case
against Ronald Trent, the ladies would give him
the benefit of the doubt. Only positive proof
would shake their faith in him, for in their minds
they had built up a dream man. It was difficult
for them to see Ronald in his true colors.</p>
<p>Realizing this, it seemed to Doris that the best
thing the girls could do would be to leave the
mansion at once. Perhaps later, the Misses Gates
would realize their error.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have caused you enough worry and pain,&rdquo;
she said quietly. &ldquo;Kitty and I will pack our
things and leave at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But our lost papers!&rdquo; Iris half sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can only tell you what we&rsquo;ve said before,&rdquo;
Doris declared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find them in Henry&rsquo;s
suitcase!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why we shouldn&rsquo;t look, at any rate,&rdquo;
Azalea murmured. &ldquo;Ronald, don&rsquo;t you think it
would be the best way to clear up this frightful
muddle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t give that much credit to the trumped-up
story,&rdquo; he returned condescendingly. &ldquo;My
dear ladies, don&rsquo;t take this matter so seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea eyed him with the first glimmer of distrust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, it happens to be <i>our</i> papers that are
missing,&rdquo; she told him tartly. &ldquo;I think we shall
have a look inside that suitcase!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora and Henry, now thoroughly frightened,
began to back toward the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Azalea asked sharply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are leaving,&rdquo; Cora told her sullenly. &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t remain in this house to be insulted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not leave until we have examined your
suitcase,&rdquo; Azalea retorted, displaying more spirit
than the girls had known she possessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not find any papers there!&rdquo; Henry cried.
&ldquo;Not unless these girls framed us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably just what they did do!&rdquo; Cora
chimed in, catching at the straw. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet they
put them in our suitcase, so as to throw suspicion
on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon know if the papers are there or not,&rdquo;
Azalea declared.</p>
<p>Realizing that they could no longer bluff, Henry
and Cora of one accord started for the door, hoping
to escape. They were abruptly halted by a
steel-like voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand where you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris and Kitty wheeled, to see Jake barring the
door. And directly behind him stood Marshmallow
and Dave!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">VINDICATION</span></h2>
<p>Doris had never seen Jake look as he did at this
moment, when he faced the group in the room.
Ignoring Cora and Henry after his first command
to them, he walked directly over to Ronald Trent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your game&rsquo;s up, Joe Jeffery,&rdquo; he said in a hard,
metallic voice. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got you cold. I&rsquo;ve been
waiting a long time to get even!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ronald stared at him a full instant and then,
with a dazed expression, sank limply down into the
nearest chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You win,&rdquo; he muttered weakly.</p>
<p>Doris ran quickly to Jake and caught him by the
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is this man?&rdquo; she cried eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police know him well enough,&rdquo; Jake
grunted. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a reward of five thousand out
for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five thousand!&rdquo; Iris gasped. &ldquo;But what has
he done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swindled folks out of their hard earned money.
He&rsquo;s been workin&rsquo; his little game for years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think he might have robbed us, if it
hadn&rsquo;t been for Doris!&rdquo; Azalea murmured. &ldquo;Oh,
what silly fools we&rsquo;ve been!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t the first to be taken in by him,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Jake responded. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a slick one.
Took me in once, but this is where we&rsquo;ll square accounts.&rdquo;
He indicated Cora and Henry. &ldquo;Who
are these folks? Friends of his?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they&rsquo;re all in the plot,&rdquo; Doris cried.</p>
<p>Henry did not deny the charge this time. Instead,
he made a sudden dash for the door.
Marshmallow and Dave were too quick for him,
however, and caught him roughly by the arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dave said grimly, forcing
him back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll stay here until we&rsquo;re through
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s he been up to?&rdquo; Jake demanded gruffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took some valuable papers belonging to the
Misses Gates,&rdquo; Doris declared. &ldquo;Kitty and I are
sure he put them into his suitcase, intending to get
away some time today before the loss was discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at that suitcase, then,&rdquo; Jake
directed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it,&rdquo; Doris cried.</p>
<p>She and Kitty hurried up to the third floor and
entered the Sully apartment. Etta was sleeping
and they did not awaken her, but quickly took the
suitcase from beneath the bed and carried it downstairs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>Removing the articles of clothing, Doris took out
the two envelopes and handed them to Iris. She
ripped them open and brought to light negotiable
oil bonds, an important deed, and several other
papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we have them back,&rdquo; she sighed in
relief, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t understand why any one would
wish to steal them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see one of those bonds,&rdquo; Dave said.</p>
<p>Iris handed over one of the certificates. He
studied it for an instant and then gave a low exclamation
of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, these are Standard Condonite!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that the name meant little to the Misses
Gates, he hastened to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Standard Condonite is one of the new oil companies
that has been growing like a mushroom.
The stock has tripled in value during the last
year!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then our bonds really are valuable!&rdquo; Azalea
exclaimed. She looked accusingly at Henry and
Cora who had the grace to hang their heads.
&ldquo;You knew this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man put us up to stealing them,&rdquo; Henry
muttered, indicating Ronald Trent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand how you knew we had
them,&rdquo; Iris murmured in bewilderment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;My wife heard you and Miss Azalea talking
one day and you mentioned your bonds,&rdquo; Henry
offered. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t think anything more about it
until that man Trent came here. He gave us
money to tell him what property you had. He
wanted us to git this stuff for him. Said he&rsquo;d give
us part of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you thought you&rsquo;d hog the whole of it,&rdquo;
Trent added bitterly. &ldquo;You were planning to get
away before I got wise to your scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there&rsquo;s no honor among thieves,&rdquo;
Doris observed dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we had back the money we gave away!&rdquo;
Iris said regretfully. &ldquo;We need it so badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much did you give the rascal?&rdquo; Jake asked
bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly eight hundred dollars in all. Only
yesterday we went to the bank and drew out five
hundred. It was practically our last cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake crossed over to the swindler and jerked him
roughly out of the chair into which he had slumped.
Quickly he went through his pockets and brought
out a fat billfold. From this he extracted a number
of bills which he placed upon the table.</p>
<p>Eagerly Azalea and Iris counted the money. In
all it came to five hundred and fifty-two dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ll get back,&rdquo; Jake told
them. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s likely spent the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better than losing everything,&rdquo; Azalea declared
gratefully, &ldquo;and we have our bonds which
we can sell.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want done with these birds?&rdquo;
Jake next asked. &ldquo;I have a private grudge with
Jeffery so he&rsquo;s going to jail, but you can do what
you please with the other two, for all of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea and Iris looked doubtfully at each other,
and the Sullys, observing their indecision, began to
plead for their freedom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t mean to steal,&rdquo; Cora said tearfully.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always been so good and kind to us. For
the sake of little Etta&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me you haven&rsquo;t considered her yourself
until now,&rdquo; Azalea interrupted. &ldquo;However,
we are not without sympathy even for those who
have plotted against us. Cora, I feel that you
have allowed your husband to lead you astray.
Your mother worked for us a number of years and
I promised her that I would try to see that you
never came to grief. For that reason Iris and I
shall permit you and your husband to go free, providing
you promise to lead a straight life from this
day on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We promise,&rdquo; the two murmured together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take your things and leave the house immediately.
You have demonstrated that you are
unfit parents, so Etta must be left behind. You
may go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cora and Henry, without a word of thanks,
rushed out of the room. Within half an hour they
had left the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll be gettin&rsquo; this fellow out of your way,&rdquo;
Jake declared briskly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; Iris said quietly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
quite sure there can be no mistake. This man is
really Joe Jeffery and not Ronald Trent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no mistake, ma&rsquo;am. He&rsquo;s just an impostor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did he ever learn of John Trent?&rdquo;
Doris demanded. She turned to Ronald. &ldquo;What
do you know about my uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell us,&rdquo; Azalea begged. &ldquo;It will mean
so much to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to Cloudy Cove and find out for yourselves,&rdquo;
he snapped, forgetting that he had ever treated the
twins in a courtly manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but we are too old to travel,&rdquo; Iris sighed.
&ldquo;If only we could find out what became of John!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; Doris volunteered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How kind of you!&rdquo; Azalea murmured gratefully.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done so much for us already. I
don&rsquo;t know how we can ever repay you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not looking for pay,&rdquo; Doris returned with
a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad of an opportunity to look
into the matter for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her promise was not an idle one. Very shortly,
Doris and her friends were to go to Cloudy Cove,
there to learn more of the details of John Trent&rsquo;s
strange career. Her adventures in this connection
are related in the volume entitled, &ldquo;<span class="sc">Doris Force
at Cloudy Cove</span>, or, The Old Miser&rsquo;s Signature.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>Jake telephoned to the police station and within
fifteen minutes the officers arrived to take charge
of Joe Jeffery. They positively identified him
as a notorious swindler and assured Doris and
her friends that the reward money would go to
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Jake and the Misses Gates should have
it,&rdquo; Doris declared. &ldquo;The money will make up for
what Ronald took!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we wouldn&rsquo;t think of taking it,&rdquo; Azalea and
Iris protested. &ldquo;You and your chum were really
responsible for capturing the man. You saved
our money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; Jake protested. &ldquo;I just
came here as Doris asked me to, and then when I
saw that bird I recognized him. I don&rsquo;t want any
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a situation!&rdquo; Doris laughed. &ldquo;Five
thousand dollars and no one wants it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I have an idea,&rdquo; Marshmallow broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unburden yourself,&rdquo; Doris laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, since no one of you is willing to accept
the money, why not divide it equally among you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doris should have the greater share, though,&rdquo;
Jake protested. &ldquo;She was the one who was responsible
for solving the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you landed the <i>coup de grace</i>,&rdquo; Doris insisted.</p>
<p>Jake scratched his head and grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The which?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Coup de grace</i>&mdash;that&rsquo;s French. It means the
finishing stroke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon Joe Jeffery is finished all right,&rdquo; Jake
agreed. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t try to swindle any more
people out of their hard earned cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After considerable discussion it was decided that
the reward money should be divided between
Doris, Kitty, the Misses Gates and Jake. The
Misses Gates declared at first that they would accept
no share, but Doris and her friends, realizing
how badly they needed ready money, insisted that
they take it. At last they gave in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t do a thing to help bring Ronald&mdash;I
mean Joe Jeffery to justice,&rdquo; Azalea murmured.
&ldquo;We even hindered you, Doris, thinking you were
prejudiced against him. It doesn&rsquo;t seem fair that
we take anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you and your sister refuse your share, then
I&rsquo;ll not take mine either,&rdquo; Doris told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us take one share between us,&rdquo; Iris protested.</p>
<p>Doris shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we must share alike. It makes easier
arithmetic, too. An even thousand dollars apiece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand dollars!&rdquo; Kitty gasped. &ldquo;Am I
actually to get that much? I think I&rsquo;m going to
faint!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Marshmallow invited impudently.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll catch you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Two thousand dollars,&rdquo; Azalea murmured, and
looked almost tearfully at her sister. &ldquo;It <i>will</i>
mean a great deal to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you accept?&rdquo; Doris asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we must, but only on one condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you accept a reward from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another reward!&rdquo; Doris gasped. &ldquo;One is sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t refer to money,&rdquo; Iris said. &ldquo;This is
just a token of our appreciation.&rdquo; She hesitated,
and then went on with a brave smile. &ldquo;Azalea and
I would like you to have the ruby ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To keep?&rdquo; Doris questioned in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Iris returned quietly. &ldquo;You understand
why we cannot wear it ourselves and you admire it
so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never dreamed of owning such a lovely ring!&rdquo;
Doris gasped in delight. &ldquo;Why, I am sure it is
very valuable, too. I really don&rsquo;t like to take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do,&rdquo; the twins begged. &ldquo;We have no
wish to keep it in the house, now that&mdash;well, you
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doris became aware that Kitty was nudging her
vigorously in the back and recognized it as a hint
that her chum hoped she would accept the gift.
She debated an instant and then smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t begin to thank you for it,&rdquo; she told the
Misses Gates gratefully. &ldquo;It will serve to remind
me always of our thrilling adventure here at
Locked Gates. And if ever the time should come
when you want it back&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Azalea shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That time will never come, my dear. It is
yours with no strings attached. Beautiful jewels
were meant for young girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ring is so beautiful I&rsquo;ll be afraid of losing
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can have it reset,&rdquo; Azalea suggested.</p>
<p>It was some time before Doris thought about
asking Jake if he had brought the money which
she had requested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;When I received
your message, I thought something was
wrong, so I just left the money in the bank and
brought Marshmallow and Dave instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you used your own judgment,&rdquo; Doris
assured him, &ldquo;although I never would have lent
that man my money when it came right down to it.
Now my bank account is still intact, and I&rsquo;ll have
another thousand to add to it. I guess Uncle
Wardell will think I have the makings of a business
woman!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Doris and Kitty planned to return home with
Jake and their friends, but the Misses Gates would
not hear of them departing until after luncheon.
After the excitement had died down and all questions
had been satisfactorily answered, the girls
escorted Jake and the young men about the
grounds. Kitty and Marshmallow made excellent
use of the opportunity to strengthen their acquaintance.</p>
<p>At one o&rsquo;clock the Misses Gates served a delightful
meal in the garden. Since Cora and
Henry Sully had departed in great haste, the twins
had been forced to prepare it with their own hands,
but this they insisted was an honor and a pleasure.
In spite of all that had transpired, it seemed to
Doris and Kitty that Azalea and Iris were far
happier than they had been a few days before.</p>
<p>Doris had not forgotten Etta Sully and wondered
what was to become of her. She intended to bring
up the subject but, before she could do so, Azalea
mentioned it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iris and I have been talking it over,&rdquo; she said
to the group after luncheon was over, &ldquo;and it
seems to us that Etta should be sent to a special
home for cripples. She will need medical attention
and of course her education has been sadly
neglected. We have decided to use the reward
money for that purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be lovely of you,&rdquo; Doris declared.</p>
<p>The girls insisted upon helping with the dishes
and, as Marshmallow and Dave volunteered as
&ldquo;second assistants,&rdquo; the work was dispatched with
rapidity and a great deal of fun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I declare, I feel ten years younger with so many
young people around,&rdquo; Iris laughed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hate
to see you leave, Doris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will come back often, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Azalea
pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Kitty and I shall be driving this way often,
I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Doris returned.</p>
<p>Not until late in the afternoon did the party take
leave of the Misses Gates. The twins accompanied
them to the car which was to take them back to
Chilton, and waved until they rounded a corner
and were lost to view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, after you accustom yourself to a
place, it doesn&rsquo;t seem so spooky,&rdquo; Kitty commented
as they rode slowly along the street.
&ldquo;I can honestly say I&rsquo;ve learned to like Locked
Gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like olives,&rdquo; Doris laughed. &ldquo;The first
taste is rather unpleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you didn&rsquo;t know what you were getting
into when you went there, did you?&rdquo; Marshmallow
asked. &ldquo;Doris, your Uncle Ward will certainly be
surprised when you tell him all that has happened
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And won&rsquo;t he be delighted to see me coming
home with reward money!&rdquo; Doris exclaimed. &ldquo;He
was a little afraid this trip would prove an expensive
one. As a matter of fact, it&rsquo;s turned out to
be an investment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was certainly the most exciting three weeks
I ever spent,&rdquo; Kitty said with a blissful sigh. &ldquo;I
enjoyed every minute of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; Doris agreed. &ldquo;From now on, we
won&rsquo;t be always wondering why the mansion gates
are locked, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; Dave grinned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve unraveled
all the mysteries and unearthed all the secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite all,&rdquo; Doris corrected. &ldquo;I must find
out about my Uncle John Trent&rsquo;s estate, and something
tells me it may offer difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may offer more than that,&rdquo; Dave replied
soberly. &ldquo;Doris Force, when you go to Cloudy
Cove, you may discover you&rsquo;ve inherited a fortune!&rdquo;</p>
